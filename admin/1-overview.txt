Directory:	admin

Overview:	

Administrative functions for managing database definitions, users, data verification and recovery, bulk changes etc.

Notes:	

Administrative functions specific to individual users (eg. management of tags and creation of colleague groups) can be found in /uprofile

No particular effort has been made to brand or beautify the administrative interface – it is pretty much as first conceived in 2005/2006; it does the job effectively in part though its lack of sophistication, so we have followed the “if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it” principle, preferring to concentrate on new features and end-user usability.
