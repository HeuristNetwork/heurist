Directory:	/admin

Overview:

This directory contains all the administrative interface code from Heurist Vsn 3, also used by Heurist Vsn 4 and 5.

Vsn 6: In the end, all this is fairly simple code which has worked for years and has no relation to the performance and structure 
of the main data entry and retrieval functions, so it has been left untouched. It is the product of many hands, but it works.
