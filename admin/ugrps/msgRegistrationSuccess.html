            Your registration request has been sent to an administrator for approval

            Note: Approvals for databases on HeuristScholar.org are normally processed within an hour or so,
            <br />
            unless it is the early hours of the morning in Sydney (UTC + 10) or during major holidays.
            <br>
            Approval times for other databases will depend on the owner/administrator of that database.

        <p><b>If you don't get an approval</b></p>
        <p><i>
            If you don't receive the confirmation email within a reasonable delay,
            it may have been blocked by your spam filters.
            <br />
            You can attempt to log in anyway. If your login does not work, send your details
            to the database owner for manual addition.
