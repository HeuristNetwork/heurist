<!-- <br /> -->
<p>Dear ##GivenNames##</p>
<!-- <br /> -->
<p>Thanks for signing up for a Heurist database. This email is to offer you some personalised help in getting started.</p>
<!-- <br /> -->
<p>&lt;FrenchNoteIfFrance&gt;</p>
<p>This help is free and without obligation. The software is Open Source on gitHub and the web services are free to use. The project is entirely non-profit, supported by collaborative grants, voluntary contributions, occasional consulting, and servers provided by the University of Sydney and by Huma-Num for France/Europe.</p>
<!-- <br /> -->
<p>Nearly everyone needs database(s) for some part of their work, but Heurist's user interface is both rich and non-prescriptive, so your first reaction after creating a database may well have been "what do I do next?". So please let us help you understand how Heurist fits into your research or management of resources. Simply send a brief description of your project(s) - see the grey box at the end of this email - and we will get back to you, generally within the day, to offer some specific pointers. Once you're over the initial hump you will start to see the immense benefits in cost, implementation time, control, retrieval and publishing features and sustainability, which flow from using Heurist. Since the list runs to more than a page I've attached it as a PDF document.</p>
<!-- <br /> -->
<p>Recent new features (since 2019) include a generic method for moving data between databases (even if they have different structures), importing external databases including all relationships, and generating websites with CMS functions which are stored as an integral part of the database and directly embed Heurist functionality. Version 6, released early 2021, is fully compatible with older databases but provides a more intuitive interface designed in collaboration with a professional UX designer. New features include improved filtering functions including an advanced filter builder, structure editing and vocabulary management, remote data lookup in other data services, extensions to website creation including blogs, and upcoming improvements (fourth quarter 2021) to mapping and visualisation widgets and linked open data.</p>
<!-- <br /> -->
<p>Please visit the website (HeuristNetwork.org) to get an idea of the wide variety of projects using Heurist (although the list is by no means up-to-date, <em>mea culpa</em>). Heurist is in widespread use and has been actively developed since 2005. We are supporting (and supported by) enough major projects that we are confident in Heurist's medium-term sustainability (5 - 10 years or more; as long as the service is maintained, all databases and websites will remain viable). The software can generate complete self-documenting archive packages for each database providing for long term preservation.</p>
<!-- <br /> -->
<p>We also pride ourselves on our responsiveness and deal rapidly with all bug reports - generally within a day. We don't think we're perfect and readily take on board suggestions for workflow improvements or new features, often implemented within a few days; Heurist development is deeply informed by the emergent needs of the research projects which use it.</p>
<!-- <br /> -->
<p>If you have questions or suggestions, please email us at support@HeuristNetwork.org or click on Bug Report in the Help menu. You will get a domain-knowledgeable reply, not just an IT help service.</p>
<!-- <br /> -->
<p>We look forward to being able to assist you.</p>
<!-- <br /> -->
<p>Kind Regards</p>
<!-- <br /> -->
<p>Ian Johnson</p>
