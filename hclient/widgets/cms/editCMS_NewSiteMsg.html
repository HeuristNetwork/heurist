<p>To save you time we have created a set of commonly used menu entries and web pages with dummy content.</p>
                            
<p>The website editor always opens in a new tab in order to give you enough screen space to visualise the final result.</p>
 
<p>You can switch to and fro between this view and the standard interface, editing the data or creating filters, and refreshing the web editor page to see the results.</p>
                            
<p>Please use <b>Menu</b> tab to delete the menu entries you don\'t need or to rename them 
(don't forget to change the title of the page which is generally a longer version of the menu label). You can also add new ones.</p>

<p>Tab <b>Page</b> allows to edit current page structure and modify widget properties.</p>

<p>Click on elements on page to edit their content directly.</p>
