<p>To save you time we have created a set of commonly used menu entries and web pages with dummy content.</p>
                            
<p>The website editor opens in a new tab in order to give you enough screen space to work comfortably and visualise the final result.</p>
 
<p>You can switch to and fro between the website editor view and the standard interface where you can edit the data or create filters. Refresh the web editor page to see changes made in the database.</p>
                            
<p>Use the <b>Site</b> tab in the website editor to add new menu entries, to delete the menu entries you don't need or to rename them 
(you should also change the title of the page, which is generally a longer version of the menu entry).</p>

<p>Use the <b>Page</b> tab in the website editor to edit the current page structure and modify the component styles and widget properties.</p>

<p>Click on text elements in the page to edit their content directly in WYSIWYG mode.</p>
