Overview:   Functions to manage a CMS-based website within a Heurist database. Developed late 2019.
            
            To configure a default look for all websites created on a particular server, 
            eg. adding institutional headers, copy cmsTemplate.php to the parent 
            of the Heurist code (normally /HEURIST/)
            
            You may use several tempates per server (for specific websites). Name cmsTemplate.php arbitrary, 
            copy to /HEUIST root folder and specify this name for field "Template file name" (field 2-922) 
            in CMS home page record
