<h2>Simple search</h2>
<p>The search field in the middle of the page searches for People using all fields in the database including the person's names, places, schools, universities and colleges, and the text of the Book of Remembrance. The search is a simple text search, is not case sensitive and partial matches will be found. All entered words must be matched, although the order does not matter.</p>
<p>For example, to find  <i>Kenneth Knowlton Saxby</i> you could enter the full name or <i>Ken Saxby</i> or <i>Saxby Knowlton</i> or simply <i>Saxby</i> (as there is only one record containing Saxby). Shorter strings will tend to be less discriminating - <i>Knowlton</i> will find this person, but <i>Know</i> finds 68 people. As this is a free text search, it is possible a search on place may return additional entries not associated with the place - for instance a search for <i>ridge wood</i> will find people associated with Ridgewood, but also people who studied at Cambridge and were killed at Polygon Wood.</p>
<p>To search for an exact phrase, use double quotation marks "". Please note that in this case the phrase must be exactly as it appears in the database including the same punctuation. For example: <i>"Women's College", "St. Paulâ€™s College", "St. Andrew's College", "St. John's College"</i> (note the full-stop after St. and the apostrophes in the last three).</p>
<p>The people retrieved by the text search are displayed below the search box with 'facets' (see below) on the left, which allow further filtering.</p> 

<h2>Facets</h2>

<p>The results can be refined using the 'facets' (database values) on the left hand side of the search results page. The facets allow you to refine your search according to eg university, qualification, school. gender or place of birth. Different types of facet as shown above - list, slider, search or dropdown - can be used depending on the type and number of values involved. </p>
<p>When you apply an additional filter to your original search using one of the facets, all the other facets will adjust to show the number of people who still satisfy each of the criteria (number in a circle). </p>
<p>Use the return arrow icon next to a selected facet to undo that filter, or the Reset <i>filters</i> button to undo the filtering by all the facets - this will leave your original text search in place.</p>

<h2>Search menu</h2>

<p>The search link in the menu at the top of the page applies different sets of facets</p>
<p>When an option is selected from the Search menu after a simple search has been carried out, the facets specified by that option are displayed applied to the search results:</p>
