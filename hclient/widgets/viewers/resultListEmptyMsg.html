    displayed when you first load Heurist, or you may enter a search/filter in the filter field above

<h3>Creating and saving filters</h3> 
<div>
    <p> 
        Filters (aka searches) are used to find information in the database and to create subsets  
        to which different actions can be applied - editing, listing, tagging, mapping, export etc.  
        If you are not using filters,  
        and in particular <a href="context_help/advanced_search.html" target="_blank">  
            <b>Saved filters and Facet searches</b></a>, you are not getting the best out of Heurist. 
    </p> 
    <p>
        Use the search/filter field at the top of the page to find records / define a filter. 
        The filter setup icon  
        <img src="hclient/assets/filter_form_icon_black.png">
        <!-- <span class="ui-icon ui-icon-filter-form" style="display:inline-block;height:18px;width:18px"></span> -->
        helps build simple filters.  
        More complex filters can be built by following instructions linked from  
        <a href="context_help/advanced_search.html" target="_blank"><b>filter help</b></a> 
        below the Search/Filter box.  
    </p>     
    <p>
        After running a filter, click the <b>Save Filter</b> button (which only appears 
        after a filter has been run) to save it in the tree in the navigation panel on the left. 
    </p>     
    <p>Simple to very complex filters, including Facet queries and Rule-based expansion of query results,  
        can be built by right-clicking in the tree in the navigation panel on the left  
        and selecting New, New Faceted or New Ruleset.

<h3>Defining a startup filter</h3> 
<div >

    <p>
        A startup filter can populate this panel automatically with the set of records to which you often  
        need immediate access. For example, <i>tags:Favourites</i> (for records tagged as favourites),  
        <i>sortby:-m</i> (for recently modified records) or a more complex query retrieving, for instance,  
        recent meeting notes in date order or records relating to current projects. 
    </p> 
    <p>
        To set a startup filter, first create a suitable filter using the filter icon
        <img src="hclient/assets/filter_form_icon_black.png"> at the end of the 
        search/filter box above, then copy the filter text from the search/filter box to the Startup filter field in <i>Settings &gt; Preferences</i> (menu at top right). 
        <br/><br/>
        You can also load Heurist directly with a filter by adding a parameter <i>&amp;q=xxxx</i> to the end of the URL which you use to load Heurist (where xxxx is a valid Heurist search/filter string).
