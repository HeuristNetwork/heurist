Overview:   Perform requests to external sources to populate records

Service requests are handled within hsapi/controller/record_lookup.php

New and existing service mapping is found at hsapi/controller/record_lookup_config.json

All lookups are extenstions of the recordAction widget (hclient/widget/record/recordAction.js)

lookup_Template.js and lookup_Template.html can provide a simple template for creating new external lookups, this also includes the handling for inserting terms and record pointers.
(This template is based off of the BnF_bib lookup with some specifics stripped out)

Current Services:
 - TLCMap: Query the Time Layered Cultural Mapping of Australian history and culture database (site: tlcmap.org)
 - GeoNames: Query the Geonames databse for geographical locations covering all countries and many places (site: geonames.org)
 - GeoNames Postalcodes: Query the Geonames' postalcode database (site: geonames.org/postal-codes/)
 - MPCE: Assign keywords to a Work (Book) record from searches or by association
 - LRC18: Import record information from the ESTC_Helsinki_Bibliographic_Metadata database via searching
 - BnF Bib: Query the BnF Library's bibliographic records (site: www.bnf.fr)
 - BnF Aut: Query the BnF Library's authoritative records (site: www.bnf.fr)
 - Nomisma: Query Nomisma's database records (site: nomisma.org)

Notes:

The services can be accessed via a call to window.hWin.HAPI4.RecordMgr.lookup_external_service(request, callback), where:
 => request (JSON Object): requires at least two keys; 'service': the URL for the external API request, and 'service_type': the name of the current external lookup (e.g. tlcmap, geonames)
 => callback (Function): Function to receive the response from the server call
    -> The response variable will be a JSON object with two keys of focus; status: response status, and data: containing the response from the external API request

Alternatively, perform a simple record search by calling window.hWin.HAPI4.RecordMgr.search(request, callback), where:
 => request (JSON Object): can contain; q = heurist query (required), w = a | b (all or bookmarks), f = details of output (can be labeled 'detail'), limit, o = offset, and db = which database to query
 => callback (Function): Same as above callback
Both the MPCE and LRC18C lookups contain examples of record searching.

Result Lists (widget found at hclient/widget/viewers/resultList.js) can be used to display the retrieved data as records in a list format for the user to select from.

When returning values to the Heurist record form, for fields that are record pointers (resources) or terms, the id for the corresponding record/term neeeds to be inserted. 
In the BnF_bib lookup, new terms in term fields are added automatically. Values for record pointers are fed in order of mapped fields to the data entry form as a search on the specified field, 
allowing the user to choose between alternatives or create a new record as required. Relationship markers are not handled.
