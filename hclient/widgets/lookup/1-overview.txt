Overview:	Perform requests to external sources to populate records

Service requests are handled within hsapi/controller/record_lookup.php

New and existing service mapping is found at hsapi/controller/record_lookup_config.json

All lookups are extenstions of the recordAction widget (hclient/widget/record/recordAction.js)

lookupTCL.js and lookupTCL.html can provide a very simple template for creating new external lookups, but also look at the BnF lookups which have handling for inserting terms and record pointers.

TODO 7 Feb 2022: The improvements for terms and record pointers should be migrated to the general template.

Notes:

The services can be accessed via a call to window.hWin.HAPI4.RecordMgr.lookup_external_service(request, callback), where:
 => request (JSON Object): requires at least two keys; 'service': the URL for the external API request, and 'service_type': the name of the current external lookup (e.g. tclmap, geonames)
 => callback (Function): Function to receive the response from the server call
    -> The response variable will be a JSON object with two keys of focus; status: response status, and data: containing the response from the external API request

Result Lists (widget found at hclient/widget/viewers/resultList.js) can be used to display the retrieved data as records in a list format for the user to select from.

When returning values to the Heurist record form, for fields that are record pointers (resources) or terms, the id for the corresponding record/term neeeds to be inserted. In the BnF lookup, new terms in term fields are added automatically. Values for record pointers are fed sequentially to the data entry form as a search on the specified field, alloing the user to choose between alternatives or create a new record as required. Relationship markers are not handled.
