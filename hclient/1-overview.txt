Directory:    /hclient

Overview:       Client-side functions, H4 onwards (late 2015). See also hserv for server-side functions
                The client side functions are html and javascript which communicate with the server-side php functions.
                The data-critical, search and visualisation parts of the Heurist infrastructure are handled by hserv and hclient
                
                Other directories in the root contain older code (pre 2015) which carries out simple tasks such as database setup
                and simple listing, or server scripts and configurations. They use a variety of methodologies, but we have not had
                the resources, or priorities, to retwrite them sicne they still work quite adequately and are low risk.
