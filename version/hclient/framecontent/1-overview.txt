Overview:   Various H4 functions to build visual components and carry out functions on the search page

Some operations require too many resources and code to include them into main set of loaded code on permanent base. They are loaded dynamically in frame.
This frame can be created and initialized
1) either in widget (to handle events such as Selection, Start/Stop of search etc) - example app_timemap.js
2) or in top.HEURIST4.msg.showDialog
3) or page can be loaded as standalone/independent page
