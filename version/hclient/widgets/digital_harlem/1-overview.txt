NOTES:

Saved (facet) searches are shown as buttons in the lefthand panel based on their occurence in the
Digital Harlem 1915 - 1930 group 1007 or a Year of the Riot 1935 group 1010 (set in dfh_search.js line 30).
The order in which these buttons are presented in the interface is determined by saved search ID. 

Map documents occur as Featued Individuals (pull down in left panel) ro Featured Maps (clickable thumbnails 
in Maps panel on the right) according to value of Featured Map or Individual field (field 144), which specifies
map or individual and which of the interfaces (1915-30 or 1935) the map document will appear in.

Web content records (type 25) define the buttons along the top and the content which pops up when they are clicked
