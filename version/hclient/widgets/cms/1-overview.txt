Overview:   Functions to manage a CMS-based website within a Heurist database. Developed late 2019.
            
            To configure a default look for all websites created on a particular server, 
            eg. adding institutional headers, copy /hclient/widgets/cms/cmsTemplate.php to the parent 
            of the Heurist code (normally /HEURIST/)
            
            You may use several templates per server (for specific websites).
            We encourage the following of naming convention cmsTemplate_OrganisationName.php
            Copy to /HEURIST root folder and specify this name in the field "Website Template" (field 2-922) 
            in the Advanced tab of the CMS home page record.
            
            The template can also be specified as a relative path hclient/widgets/cms/<template name> but this
            should ONLY be used for development as it uses a path which might change and local changes could
            get overwritten by code updates.
