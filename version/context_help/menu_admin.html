                The <b>Admin</b> menu provides methods for creating, opening and deleting databases, managing users and worgroups, and utilities for verifying and correcting databases. A passworded section allows the manager of a Heurist server to carry out verification operations across all databases on the server.

                    <h3>Open</h3>
                    <p>
                        Use this to select a database among all the databases on the server. You can filter for the database you are after (often identified by your 'prefix', beign the 5 first letters of your family name, unless you changed it or the database was created for a specific project). 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You will be asked to login to the database, so you can only open databases to which you have access.

                    <h3>New</h3>
                    <p>
                        Creates a new database, owned by you, populating it with a set of frequently used and key record types, fields and vocabularies. Some record types and fields are protected against deletion as they are required by the system eg. for mapping or bibliography synchronisation, but msot mayu be freely modified or deleted. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It is important to choose a short but informative name, since there may be thousands of databases on the server. Avoid using "test" in your database name, the word adds nothing, your database is a test until it is not a test ...  
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You will be able to define who, apart from yourself, has access to the database.

                    <h3>Clone</h3>
                    <p>
                        Makes an identical copy of the database. That means all structure, all data and all workgroups/uusers/permissions are copied over. You can clone a database on which you have limited rights, but you will only have the same rights on the clone.
                    </p><p>
                        Please avoid making clones, particualrly of large databases, as they use up lots of disk space and can annoy the IT centres hosting the service. If you need a copy for an experiment, please delete the original or the extra copy once finished. If you want to make a backup, prefer Publish > Archive Package. 
                    </p>

                    <h3>Delete database</h3>
                    <p>
                        This will delete the database completely, including all uploaded files and other work. Although deletion makes a temporary archive copy which can be restored for a period, this is not guaranteed and makes significant work for the server manager, so please be sure you want to delete the database.

                    <h3>Clear contents</h3>
                    <p>
                        This clears all data records (entities) from the database and resets the record ID counter to zero so new records will have an ID starting at 1. 
                    </p><p>
                        Clearing content does not affect the structure of the database (record types, fields, vocabularies and terms), nor the workgroups, users and permissions defined. If the database has been registered, its database ID wioll not be affected.

                    <h3>Workgroups</h3>
                    <p>
                        This function manages workgroups, which can be added, edited and deleted (except workgroup 1 = Database Managers). It allows users to be allocated to workgroups and the setting of access roles (administrator or member) in each workgroup. New users can also be added.
                    </p><p>
                        Database structure can only be modified by administrators in the Database Managers workgroup, although other users can add terms to term fields (dropdowns) during data entry. 
                    </p><p>
                        Each record is owned by a workgroup, or by an individual user, and only the owner can edit the data within the record.

                    <h3>Users</h3>
                    <p>
                        This function allows the editing of user's data such as name, password, email, interests etc. It also allows addition of a new user, deletion of users, or de/re-activating a user.
                    </p><p>
                        Modifications can only be made by the user themself or by the administrators in the Database Managers workgroup.

                    <h3>Import user</h3>
                    <p>
                        If a user is required who already has a profile in another database on this server, this function allows selection of the database and import of the user's profile. 
                    </p><p>
                        The workgroup membership and access rights of the imported user are not assigned automatically, as they may be inappropriate. After import a dialogue allows the user to be assigned to workgroups as required, with a specified role in each (administrator or member).

                    <h3>Verify integrity</h3>
                    <p>
                        Databases are very complex entities, and while the software tries to avoid errors, some can creep in, notably during the import of data where we have preferred to relax data verification in favour of fix-up within Heurist, rather than requiring data to be made perfect before import. </p><p>
                        A range of different structure and data integrity checks are run and errors are reported, along with buttons to fix certain structural errors and links which retrieve sets of records with a particular type of error, allowing the records to be corrected.
                    </p><p>
                        Errors reported include: structural errors, bad pointer fields, orphaned records, missing values and wrong number of values in a field, invalid characters, bad title masks, errors in dates and unrecognised term values etc. Green text indicates OK, orange indicates a problem.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Manage files</h3>
                    <p>
                        Displays a browser view of all files (images, documents, spreadsheets etc.)uploaded to the database. The files can be filtered by filename, path and file type, sorted by nmame, by size, or by date uploaded, the metadata on the file can be edited, and files can be deleted.
                    </p><p>
                        Files can be referenced in multiple records, but can also be orphaned (ie. not referenced by any record). Files can be referenced both as File field values, or as links or images within an html text eg. for CMS web pages or blog pages. Imported files will initially be orphaned, until Index media is run (which creates a Media item record for each file without such a record) or they are referenced manually within a record.
                    </p><p>
                        Manage files can also manage links to external files (files referenced via a URL to a stable repository on the internet) which are treated exactly like uploaded files for most purposes. External references to an external video streaming server are recommended for all videos, both to reduce server storage and load and because streaming services will do a better job of serving videos.

                    <h3>Rebuild record titles</h3>
                    <p>
                        Constructed record titles are short(ish) titles generated automatically for each record by combining data values stored in fields in the record. This allows the record to be easily identified in result lists. 
                    </p><p>Constructed record titles can become out-of-date where one record type references the constructed title of another in its constructed title. This does not in any way affect the operation of the database, it is purely cosmetic. 
                    </p><p>
                        Running this funtion will rebuild all constructed titles from the data. If there are several levels of dependence you might need to run this function a couple of times to correct all titles.
                    </p>
                </div>
            </div>

                <div>
                    <h3>Find duplicate records</h3>
                    <p>
                        Flexible data entry and repeating fields makes it hard to block the entry of duplicate records. This function compares the constructed titles of all records in the database and reports groups of records that appear to have similar titles. The sensitivity of the comparison can be varied, and the comparison can be restricted to records of the same type or applied across record types. Where duplication is incorrectly suggested, that cobination can be blocked from further reporting.
                    </p><p>
                        Controls against each group identified allow merging of records deemed to be duplicates. Fields which occur in more than one of the merged records can be added as repeats or one value can be chosen over the other before the merge is actually carried out.
                    </p><p>
                        All pointers to merged records are redirected to the merged result, as are PID references to one of the merged records. Tags and reminders are also attached to the merged result.
