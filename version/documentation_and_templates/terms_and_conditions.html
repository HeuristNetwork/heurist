                    and to give adequate warning if for any reason our support of the systems
                    is to be reduced or discontinued. However, you agree that we provide no
                    express or implied warranties in relation to the operation, reliability or
                    security of the systems or otherwise, nor in relation to the content of any

                    academic or individual user in our absolute discretion. We may at some time
                    need to limit new registrations and/or access if usage of the systems
                    exceeds our ability to service traffic.

                <li>
                    We reserve the right to block/remove any users who we determine in our
                    absolute discretion abuse the system or enter inappropriate content,
                    without recourse and without explanation.

                    Other authorised/logged-in users of a specific database are able to view the
                    contact details of persons who added, edited or tagged records in that specific
                    database - this only applies WITHIN a specific database, not across databases. By using this system you agree that your contact details may be made available in this manner to other users of the databases to which you have access.

                <li>
                    Other authorised/logged-in users of a specific Heurist database can view and search across
                    all tags you use within that database, and may be able to search across all text
                    you have entered, in order to identify records of interest, however other users of a
                    database cannot view text marked as private (private notes, password reminders etc.).
