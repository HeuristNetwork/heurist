Request by Heurist to Icons8 (07/03/2020)

"I am writing to you to request permission to use a small subset of your icons at 16x16 and 64x64 size, bitmap only, in our open-source project Heurist (http://heuristnetwork.org). We request permission to include up to a couple of hundred of your icons  as 16x16 and 64x64 pixel bitmap images (png or gif) in the source code of Heurist (we will not include vector images or larger versions). Since this is open source software, including these icon images in the code may be considered distributing your content. We would therefore like to ask for permission for this use, with attribution and a link to Icons8, in the source code of Heurist and in a menu entry 'Acknowledgements'."

Permission granted by Icons8 to Heurist (09/03/2020)

"We can give you a permission to use our icons in your open-source project. Please, put a link to our website in your project and also on your GitHub page, if you have one."
