Overview:	Functions linking Heurist with the FAIMS (Federated Archaeological Information Management System)
            mobile data collection system (http://fedarch.org)

            Allows Heurist to generate a FAIMS Module (xml and bsh files defining the database structure and user interface).
            Re-imports FAIMS data from a FAIMS module tarfile or direct from the FAIMS server database.
            Exports data to the TDar repository system

Notes:      Work carried out for a NeCTAR grant (2011-2013) and ARC LIEF grant (2014-2015)
