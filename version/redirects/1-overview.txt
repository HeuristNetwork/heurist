Directory:	/redirects

Overview:

This directory contains redirector files to the functions which are called across servers,
notably to the Heurist Master Index Server (HeuristPlus.sydney.edu.au).

By using these redirectors, we avoid dependency on scripts remaining in the same location  eg. if the program code is restructured or new versions are written. That means that a newer, restructured version of
the code can be accessed by an older version on a remote server, without the latter seeing any difference.

Version ( eg. _V1) suffix is used to allow new versions of the target scripts to generate different output
without breaking older code on third party servers

Some files are intended to provide a stable shortcut to a specific output, such as record view,
which is human readable and may be referenced at a stable URL. If no version suffix is included
the redirect is to human-readable output which may be changed/improved ie. it is a stable reference
but to content which may potentially change in its detailed form.
