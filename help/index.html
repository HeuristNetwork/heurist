<p><strong>This is a placeholder for the Heurist Help system</strong></p>

<p>Please ask your system administrator to copy the Heurist help files distributed on the 
Open Source website into the /help folder of this Heurist installation.</p>

<p>We recommend placing the help files folder as eg. HEURIST_HELP in the parent directory of the Heurist installation 
- often the root web directory - and simlinking this folder as /help in the Heurist installation. 
This allows the same help files to be shared across multiple Heurist installations on the server 
(eg. different versions and/or customisations)</p>
