                        You should never again lose your web bookmarks or spend time looking for a

                        Bookmarks, notes and references can be tagged (keyworded)
                        to link them to your projects, courses, topics, administrative units etc., and
                        retrieved by tag.<br>&nbsp;

                        and bibliographies can be dynamically generated from the database. Add a
                        reference and all your web pages are immediately updated.<br>&nbsp;

                        Find new references, share them with colleagues, find
                        out who else shares your interests, and find out what references are rated
                        highly by people in a particular field.<br>

                        <b>Flexible entity definitions<br>
                        </b>Heurist can handle a wide variety of other entities - research projects,
                        grants, researchers, methods, thesis topics, historical events, C14 dates
                        etc. - and can store spatial objects and uploaded files, making it an ideal
                        platform for making databases of almost anything! If you want to add a new
                        entity type/fields to an existing entity type, contact the development team
                        (new entity types can be added in minutes).<br>&nbsp;

            The <b>T1000</b> database wizard allows you to build stable, well-structured, easily modified web database
            applications in minutes without any knowledge of database programming. Databases generated with the
            T1000 wizard use portable, open-source software (MySQL and PHP) and automatically support passworded
            access, validated input, file upload, coordinates and web mapping, free text searching, pre-defined
            lookups, one-to-many and many-to-many relationships, delivery of data as a web service, RSS feeds -
            all without any extra work on your part. They can run on the Heurist server, or
            be downloaded and copied onto your server. T1000 provides the core
            functionality of Heurist and all our other online database applciations.

        <p style="width: 90%;">
            We have developed a small number of special-purpose databases, some of which
            are simply specialised views of the Heurist database. These currently include:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <p style="width: 90%;">Student topics database</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p style="width: 90%;">Seminars and events</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p style="width: 90%;">Assets and loans tracker</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p style="width: 90%;">Job tracking system</p>
            </li>
