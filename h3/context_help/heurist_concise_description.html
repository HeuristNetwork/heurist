        <p><b>Overview</b></p>

        <p>
            Heurist is a web service which captures and manages
            information about many different types of item - web bookmarks, bibliographic
            references, maps, people, events, images, projects, objects etc. (currently
            more than 60 item types - new ones are easily added). Personal notes,
            discussions, wiki pages, web links, images and geographic location can be added
            to any item in the database. Items can be cross-referenced.
        </p>

        <p>
            Heurist allows one to easily and quickly find, capture and
            share relevant information within workgroups, organise information resources
            and generate teaching/research project web site content automatically
            (including within most Content Management Systems and teaching systems such as WebCT). No programming skills are
            required.
        </p>

        <p>
            Some example web sites developed with content drawn from 
            Heurist include:
        </p>

        <p><b>Full Description</b></p>

        <p>Heurist is a free online database service which stores:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Internet bookmarks</li>
            <li>Bibliographic references</li>
            <li>
                Research data on other types of item such as
                descriptions of events, biographical records, sound recordings, photographs,
                historical maps, thesis topics, seminars etc. There are currently &gt;60 record 
                types and new ones are being added as people request them.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Heurist aims to put all of these records at your fingertips
            in a single system available anywhere, rather than as a multiplicity of
            systems tied to specific computers.
