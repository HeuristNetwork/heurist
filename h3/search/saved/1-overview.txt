Directory:	/saved_searches

Overview:	Saved searches record a Heurist query for either a single user
		or a workgroup, and are displayed in a tree on the left of the
		main search page.

Notes:		Saved searches can be used to publish subsets of the database through
		the Publish function, avoiding the needc to specify the query in the
		publication URL so that it cannot be modified externally to access
		unintended information
