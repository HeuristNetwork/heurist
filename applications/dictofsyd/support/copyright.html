multimedia items (images, video, audio) to associate with our articles. The
<i>Dictionary</i> has sought and received specific permission to use each one of
these items in the project. However, our licence does not permit us to
on-license any multimedia content to third parties. Except in a few specific
circumstances (described below) we do not provide advice about the copyright
status of multimedia items appearing in the <i>Dictionary of Sydney</i>.

or omission, please contact us.

<p>
In some circumstances we have used multimedia items which have been published
elsewhere with one of the several Creative Commons licences available. We have
indicated this fact within the metadata of the item. If you would like to know
