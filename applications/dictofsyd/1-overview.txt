Overview:   The Dictionary of Sydney website publication engine (2013 version)

            generator.php generates the complete DoS website in approximately 5 minutes.
            It was written by Artem Osmakov and debugged by Ian Johnson.
            (previous versions took a week of closely supervised activity).

Notes:      Only the PHP (~5000 lines)and XSL (~3500 lines) directories, and some files in the dictofsyd
            root directory are Heurist-specific. The rest are components of the Dictionary web site.

            This code is not (as at 22/9/15) up-to-date with any changes made by the Dictionary staff
            since late 2013, as no code changes have been submitted back to Heurist.
