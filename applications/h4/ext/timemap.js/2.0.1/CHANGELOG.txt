CHANGELOG (see the SVN commit log for more detail)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 2.0.1
-----------
- Made multiple info windows an option, not the default, for Google v3 and OpenLayers
- Added TimeMapItem#getInfoHtml and TimeMapItem#onVisibleTimeline
- Refactored TimeMap selection functions (setSelected, getSelected)
- Merged latest Mapstraction
- Updated and tested newest jQuery (1.6.2), OpenLayers (2.10)
- Added tests for info windows
- Fixed a number of small bugs

Version 2.0
-----------
- Removed dependency on Google Maps v2
- Added dependencies on jQuery and Mapstraction
- Refactored code to take advantage of jQuery
- Added customized fork of Mapstraction library
- Added support and tests for Google v2, Google v3, OpenLayers, and Bing Maps
- Added ant build script

Version 1.6
-----------
- Added progressive loader to easily load large datasets a little bit at a
time, based on timeline location.
- More changes to the loader architecture, allowing asynchronous loads to be 
cancelled, a default loader to be used, and even easier creation of new loaders
- Support for getting timemap state from the URL hash
- Support for loading extra data from arbitrary Google Spreadsheet columns
- Support for ExtendedData in KML
- Support for loading arbitrary tags in XML (KML, GeoRSS)
- Templating support for info window data
- Timestamp support in TimeMapDataset.hybridParser
- Additions and tweaks to documentation, including new template
- Some tweaks for improved performance

Version 1.5
-----------
- Fairly substantial changes to the loader architecture - should make everything a
little cleaner, and allows implementation of service-specific loaders (e.g.
Flickr, etc). IMPORTANT: Loader files have moved to the loaders/ directory.
- Some changes to TimeMap.init() syntax - the only things not backwards-compatible
are the preloadFunction and transformFunction params, which should now go in an
options object within the dataset object.
- Cleaned up theme namespace: changed TimeMapDatasetTheme to TimeMapTheme and put 
pre-set theme functions into TimeMap.themes. Setting theme by string (e.g. "blue")
is fully backwards-compatible, but the syntax for using functions has changed.
- Cleaned up utility namespace: moved utility functions to TimeMap.util
- Added documentation via jsdoc-toolkit, and cleaned up the comments to provide
better documentation
- Added loaders for JSON strings, Google Spreadsheets, and Flickr
- Added polyline and polygon support to GeoRSS
- Added support for multiple geometries in KML

Version 1.4
-----------
- Added support, tests, and one example for Timeline v.2.2.0
- Added local optimized copy of Timeline v.1.2
- Added GeoRSS parser (points only)
- Moved KML parser to separate file. NOTE: You now need to load kmlparser.js
separately to load KML, unless you are using timemap_full.pack.js.
- Improvements to default date parser
- Added several new examples: Google spreadsheet, lines between points, polytween
- New tests and small bugfixes

Version 1.3
-----------
- Relicensing with the MIT license
- some code refactoring - IMPORTANT: I removed timemapinit.js and made the init()
function a static method on TimeMap. The timemapInit() function still works (I
aliased it) but is deprecated. I also moved all post-initialization manipulation
functions to their own file, manipulation.js.
- adding json2 library and functions for exporting TimeMaps
- first release of experimental editing UI (jQuery-dependent)
- better filter chain handling
- tweaks and bugfixes

Version 1.2
-----------
- tweaks and bugfixes
- code cleanup
- a few new features, notably support for image overlays
- several new hooks for custom functions

Version 1.1
-----------
- tweaks and bugfixes
- added timemapInit() function

Version 1.0
-----------
- first release of the core library
