Overview:	Applications developed within Heurist vsn 3

Notes:

Several applications removed in 2016 cleanup:
dictofsyd, was not converted and would therefore most likely require editing to work (but no longer needed - may be useful base for other web publishing)
mobile was never properly finished and would require extensive work
proxyfilter is a standalone for filtering a specified website to restyle pages and restrict to listed content
