Directory:	/applications

Overview:	Applications developed for specific functions generally unrelated to the general structure of Heurist

Notes:

EdARC: developed as a demo for INRAP

Omeka-s : used to extract data from Omeka-s for the DEF19 database. It is database specific.


Several applications removed in 2016 cleanup:

dictofsyd, was not converted and would therefore most likely require editing to work 
(but is no longer needed - may be useful base for other web publishing)

mobile was never properly finished and would require extensive work

proxyfilter is a standalone for filtering a specified website to restyle pages and restrict to listed content
