Directory:	/woot

Overview:	A WYSIWYG text tool. Text is stored in XHTML in woot blocks
		which have individual user/workgroup permissions,
		and edited with tinyMCE editor.

Notes:		Needs updating to later version of TinyMCE and fullscreen editing ?
		currently operates in an annoying iframe (March 2010).

		The name ?woot?. Hmmm, ask Tom ?
