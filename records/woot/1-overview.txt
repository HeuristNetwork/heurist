Overview:	A WYSIWYG text tool. Text is stored in XHTML in woot blocks
		which have individual user/workgroup permissions, 
		and edited with tinyMCE editor. 

Notes:		Needs updating to later version of TinyMCE and fullscreen editing – 
		currently operates in an annoying iframe (March 2010).

		The name ‘woot’. Hmmm, ask Tom …
