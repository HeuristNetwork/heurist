[database]

prefix   = "heuristdb_"   // this will be prepended to all database names so that you
                          // can easily distinguish Heurist databases on your system
                          // It may be left blank, in which case nothing is prepended.

host     = "xxxxxxxxxxxx" // enter the host name or IP address of your MySQL server

name     = "xxxxxxxxxxxx" // the name of the blank database you have created
                          // DO NOT include the prefix, this will be added automatically 

username = "xxxxxxxxxxxx" // MySQL user with full write (create) access on this database
password = "xxxxxxxxxxxx" // corresponding password

[folders]

uploads  = "xxxxxxxxxxxx" // The name of a directory where Heurist can store uploaded 
                          // files eg. images, pdfs.
