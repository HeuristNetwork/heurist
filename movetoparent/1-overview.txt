Directory:	/movetoparent

Overview:	This directory contains files which should be placed in the parent directory
            of the codebase during installation of Heurist. 
            
            We STRONGLY recommend using /var/www/html/HEURIST as the parent directory 
            as all our server scripts, redirects and crson jobs are written for this address.
            Heurist does not touch anything outside the HEURIST root directory, except through simlinks you may add.

            heuristConfigIni.php is CRITICAL, as it sets all the local configuration parameters
