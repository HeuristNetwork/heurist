    installed ( normally /var/www/html/HEURIST ) and rename to index.html. Then add a simlink 
    to index.html in the parent of the HEURIST directory (normally /var/www/html) unless it is 
    shared with other applications which need equal, or primary, billing.

        <h1>Heurist Academic Knowledge Management System Vsn 6</h1>
        <p>Heurist is an Open Source collaborative web database service for recording, managing, analysing, visualising, publishing and archiving richly interlinked and heterogeneous research data without the need for a dedicated server, programming or a great deal of technical support. Unlike most database systems, the structure of a database can be instantly modified and extended as research needs evolve, without affecting existing content. All interaction is through a standard web browser.</p>
        <p>Heurist provides:
            web bookmarking; bibliographic functions including Zotero synchronisation; flexible data import (CSV, XML, KML, JSon, bookmarks); export of CSV, XML, JSon, KML, Gephi and archival data packages, 
            custom reporting, network, map and timeline visualisations; web site generation and management (built-in CMS). For advanced users there is an API and the ability to extend the software with new widgets.</p>
        <p>Heurist databases are inherently sustainable due to a well-documented and stable underlying MySQL data structure, shared hosting on a small number of servers, and a single point of maintenance (all databases use the same program code and are upgraded and patched automatically if required).</p>
