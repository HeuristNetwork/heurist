Directory:    /hserv/records/indexing

Overview: This directory contains indexing functions, specifically for Elastic Search

Originally developed by Jan Jaap de Groot <jjedegroot@gmail.com> around 2012 (?) 
but never used in the Heurist implementation due to installation of the Elastic Search 
java code on the server spawning a lot of security warnings

The aim of including Elastic search was:
1. to support fuzzy search 
2. to investigat ehte possibility of faster facet searches (but it is probable that the Elastic search methods 
will not align with the specificity of Heurist's nested graph structure searching capavilities)
