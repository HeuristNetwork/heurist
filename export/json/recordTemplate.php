print "REMOVE THIS HELP WHEN IMPORTING!!\nFor preparing an JSON file 
with Heurist schema which can be imported into a Heurist database.
\n
The file must indicate a source database in database=>id. 
This is added automatically when JSON or this template is exported 
from a registered Heurist database (it is set to 0 if the 
database is not registered). 
\n
In the case of data from a non-Heurist source, the file should 
indicate a database which contains definitions for all the 
record types and fields to be imported. This can either be 
the database from which this template is exported or zero or the 
target database if all the necessary record types and fields 
exist in the target (either by being imported into it or through
cloning from a suitable source). If definitions are missing Heurist 
will update the target database structure from the indicated source
(if specified). If required definitions cannot be obtained, it will 
report an error indicating the missing definitions.
\n
Values to be replaced are indicated with ALLCAPS, such as 
WKT_VALUE (WellKnownText), NUMERIC, TRM_ID, DATE etc.
\n
RECORD_REFERENCE may be replaced with a numeric or alphanumeric 
reference to another record, indicated by the id field. 
Note that this reference will be replaced with an automatically 
generated numeric Heurist record ID (H-ID), which will be different 
from the reference supplied. The reference supplied will be recorded
in a field Original ID.
\n
If you wish to specify existing Heurist records in the target 
database as the target (value) of a Record Pointer field, specify 
their Heurist record ID (H-ID) in the form H-ID-nnnn, where nnnn
is the H-ID of the target record in the target database. Specifying 
non-existent record IDs will throw an error. The record type of 
target records are not checked on import; pointers to records of
the wrong type can be found later with Admin > Verify integrity. 
\n
If you use an H-ID-nnnn format specification in the <id> tag of 
a record, it will be regarded as an unknown alphanumeric identifier 
and will simply create a new record with a new H-ID.
\n
\"URL\" This record level tag specifies a special URL 
attached directly to the record which is used to hyperlink 
record lists and for which checking can be automated. 
Primarily used for internet bookmarks.  
\n
Specify date field values in ISO format (yyyy or yyyy-mm or yyyy-mm-dd)
\n
termID= specifies any of the following, which are evaluated 
in order: local ID, concept code, label or standard code.   
If no match is found, the value will be added as a new term 
\n
Relationship markers: these are indicated by \"RELATIONSHIP_RECORD\" in 
the value. Relationship markers are special fields as they contain no data; 
they are simply a marker in the data structure indicating the display 
of relationship records which satisfy particular criteria (relationship type 
and target entity type). They also trigger the creation of relationships 
with particular parameters during data entry.
\n
Relationships should therefore be imported by importing as records of 
type RELATIONSHIP. They will appear in the marker fields when the data is 
viewed. Leave at least one copy of each relationship marker field in the 
file as this will trigger download of the field definition if it is not in 
the target database. Only one copy of each relationship marker is needed to 
trigger the download of the definition, duplicates can be deleted if there 
is a need to limit file size.
\n
The JSON file may (optionally) specify a Heurist database ID 
with database=>id. If a database ID is specified, synchronisation 
of definitions from that database will be performed before the data 
are imported. Since imported files will normally use a template for 
record types and fields exported from the target database, this is 
only useful for synchronising vocabularies and terms.\n\n";
