<h2>Zotero synchroniser setup</h2>

<h3>What is Zotero?</h3>

<p>Zotero is an academic bookmarking plugin for Firefox which is able to harvest 
bibliographic data from a growing list of web sites, such as publishjer web 
sites, citation indexes and so forth. It operates on a single computer.</p>

<h3>What is the synchroniser?</h3>

<p>The Zotero synchroniser is another Firefox plugin which exports references 
stored in Zotero to Heurist. If the references are later edited in Zotero, the 
synchroniser will re-export them to Heurist. At the present time, the 
synchronisation is one-way.<h3>Firefox plugin</h3>

<div>Like Zotero, this tool will only work with Firefox 2.0 and later (since Zotero will 
  only work with Firefox 2.0, there's not much point in making it otherwise).<p>
  Note: a Heurist button will appear next to the Zotero button in the status bar 
  - it will not appear until Zotero has been installed (the order of 
  installation is unimportant). , A right-mouse context menu is also added to 
  Zotero.</div>

 Please note: 11 Jan 2008 - there are some problems with the synchroniser 
 (doesn't recognise Zotero's date format correctly, support for additional 
 record types) which we are currently working on</div>
