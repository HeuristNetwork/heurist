        <h4>Simple search strings (filters)</h4>

        <p>
        NOTE: This page describes simple filter strings similar to Google searches, which were used up to version 4 and are easy to enter manually. These are still supported for basic searching and can therefore be quite useful (some rarely used functions are also still only available this way). Version 5 and above use complex JSon filters which are hard to construct by hand and are therefore created by filter and rule builders.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Basic search:</b> Words typed in the filter field are matched against any part of the record titles
            (only). This is very good for quickly retrieving records where
            you know what words are likely to appear in the title and the set of results will be small. However it doesn't allow
            discrimination and filtering of specific sets of records out of a large or complex
            set of records in a complete Heurist database.</p>
            <p>
            <b>Quick search:</b> the downwards arrow to the right of the filter field allows one to build a more targeted search 
            by simply choosing from a set of dropdowns for record type, field, content, negation and sorting.</p>
            <p>
            <b>Advanced search</b> is a more complete search builder which allows one to add a series of queries to the search field. 
            You will also see queries constructed by the search system, which are generally too complex to be entered by hand.</p>
            <p>
            <b>Facet search:</b> Last but not least, faceted searching allows one to set up searches which drill down through content
            following links between records and the attributes of the records encountered.</p>
            <p>
            <u>All search types can be saved as Saved Searches (filters) in the lefthand (navigation) panel using the Save Filter button.</u>u>
        </p>

        <h4>What it does</h4>

        <p>
            Searching or filtering the database allows for precisely targeted filters which will retreive precise subseyts of the database
            for specific tasks - analysis, indexing collections, publishing a web page etc.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                restriction of searches to specific record types
                (eg. journals, research projects, historical events, course units)
            </li>
            <li>
                restriction of searches to specific fields (eg. tags, creator, owner
                or web address)
            </li>
            <li>
                requiring the presence of several terms together (a AND b)
            </li>
            <li>
                requiring the presence of any of several terms (a OR b)
            </li>
            <li>
                exclusion of records in which a particular term occurs
            </li>
            <li>
                sorting to create an alphabetised list or a list with the most relevant
                entries at the top
            </li>
            <li>
                combinations of all of the above
            </li>
            <li>
                applying sets of rules to expand the search or to carry out a faceted search (as these specifications are complex, these are not documented for end users and will always be constrcuted by the RuleSet and faceted search wizards)
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Sorting can be by ID, title (default), by web address, by date added or modified, by any of the data fields or by popularity (star rating).
        </p>

        <h4>How to use it</h4>

        <p>
            Click on the down arrow to the right of the <span style="color: green;">Filter</span>. 
            You may then click on the link in the Quick Search dropdown to go to the Advanced Search popup.
            The Advanced Search popup constructs search instructions for you as you select from the pulldown values or
            type search terms in the fields. It displays the search instructions in the Search field at the top of the popup.
            You can also type or edit these instructions directly in the Search field on the
            popup or the Search field on the main page - all Search fields are
            functionally equivalent:
        </p>

        <h4>General Principles</h4>

        <p>
            By default, Heurist searches are partial string matches and require ALL
            search terms to be present:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <span class="search_term">temporal map</span> requires
                that both <span class="search_term">temporal</span> and <span class="search_term">map</span>
                be present somewhere in the title
            </li>
            <li>
                <span class="search_term">temporal</span> will also match <span class="search_term">temporality</span> and <span class="search_term">map</span> will match
                <span class="search_term">mapping</span> and <span class="search_term">unmappable</span>
            </li>
            <li>the search terms need not be in order, adjacent or whole words, and it is
                not case-sensitive
            </li>
        </ul>

        <ul>
            <li>to match a phrase, enclose it in quotes: <span class="search_term">"temporal mapping"</span></li>
            <li>to match at least one of the search terms, place uppercase OR between them: <span class="search_term">temporal OR mapping OR GIS</span></li>
            <li>to exclude records in which a search term occurs, use minus sign immediately at start of term, without space: <span class="search_term">-temporal</span> (the use of a minus sign can also precede specific fields identified by f: or field: - see below)</li>
            <li>to match values without partial string matching, use an equals sign instead of a colon: <span class="search_term">title="google calendar"</span></li>
            <li>to match values that are less than or greater than the search term, use &lt; and &gt; instead of a colon: <span class="search_term">field:year&gt;1980</span></li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Special Data Fields</h4>

        <p>To match values in a particular field in the data, specify the field followed by the search term:</p>

        <table style="font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 12px;" border="0" cellspacing="8">
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <td style="vertical-align: top; text-align: right;"><span class="search_term">title:<i>xxx</i></span></td>
                    <td>
                        Search for records with <i>xxx</i> in the title.<br>
                        This is also the default search if no field is specified.
                    </td>
                </tr>

                <tr>
                    <td style="vertical-align: top; text-align: right;"><span class="search_term">type:<i>xxx</i></span></td>
                    <td>
                        Only search records of the given type.<br>
                        The parameter <i>xxx</i> may describe the record type by name,
                        for example <span class="search_term">type:book</span> or <span class="search_term">type:"web&nbsp;bookmark"</span>;
                        or by numerical identifier, for example <span class="search_term">type:3</span> (journal article).
                    </td>
                </tr>

                <tr>
                    <td style="vertical-align: top; text-align: right;"><span class="search_term">tag:<i>xxx</i></span></td>
                    <td>
                        Search for records tagged with the given tag <i>xxx</i>.<br>
                        Note that this search will also match records tagged with a tag that <u>begins</u> with the search term;
                        for example, searching for <span class="search_term">tag:time</span> will find records tagged with <b>time</b> and <b>time</b>map,
                        but not mari<b>time</b> or mul<b>time</b>dia. Using equals instead will ONLY match tags which are the specified word, for example <span class="search_term">tag=time</span> will not match the tag <b>timemap</b>.
                    </td>
                </tr>

                <tr>
                    <td style="vertical-align: top; text-align: right;"><span class="search_term">user:<i>xxx</i></span></td>
                    <td>
                        Search for records which have been bookmarked by the specified user.<br>
                        The parameter <i>xxx</i> may be a user's name, for example <span class="search_term">user:"Ian&nbsp;Johnson"</span>;
                        or a user ID, for example <span class="search_term">user:224</span>.
                    </td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td style="vertical-align: top; text-align: right;"><span class="search_term">addedby:<i>xxx</i></span></td>
                    <td>
                        Search for records which have been added by the specified user.<br>
                        The parameter <i>xxx</i> may be a user's name, for example <span class="search_term">user:"Ian&nbsp;Johnson"</span>;
                        or a user ID, for example <span class="search_term">user:224</span>.
                    </td>
                </tr>
               <tr>
                    <td style="vertical-align: top; text-align: right;"><span class="search_term">visibility:<i>xxx</i></span></td>
                    <td>
                        Search for records which have the visibility set to a specific value.<br>
                        The values accepted are public, pending, viewable, hidden, for example <span class="search_term">{"access":"public"}</span>. viewable indicates viewable by any logged-in user, hidden indicates visible only to the owner. Use -public to find all records which are not publicly visible. You can also use simple searches such as <span class="search_term">vt:public</span> or <span class="search_term">vt:hiden</span> but negation is not supported.
                    </td>
                </tr>

                <tr>

                    <td>
                        Search for records with <i>xxx</i> anywhere in the URL.<br>
                        For example, <span class="search_term">url:google</span> will find records with URL <b>www.google.com</b>, <b>www.google.com.au</b>
                        and <b>en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google</b>.
                    </td>

                    <td>
                        Search for records with <i>xxx</i> anywhere in your private notes (if searching "My&nbsp;Resources")
                        or the information scratchpad (if searching "All&nbsp;Resources").

                        Search for records that were last modified before / after / on the given date.
                        The date may be specified as an ISO format date (e.g. <span class="search_term">before:2007-10-28</span>),
                        using human-readable date formats (e.g. <span class="search_term">after:"3 June 2006"</span>),
                        or as a relative date (e.g. <span class="search_term">date:"last Tuesday"</span> or <span class="search_term">after:"60 days ago"</span>
                        or <span class="search_term">after:"today"</span>).<br>
                        It is also possible to specify the date down to one-second precision
                        (e.g. <span class="search_term">before:"12.30pm November 22"</span> or <span class="search_term">date="1945-07-16 05:29:45"</span>).
                        Additionally, operators such as <span class="search_term">modified&gt;2001-09-11</span>, <span class="search_term">modified&lt;yesterday</span> may be used.
                    </td>

        <h4>Data Fields</h4>

        Data fields vary between record types, however different record types may
        (and often do) share some of the same fields.

        <br>&nbsp;

        <table style="font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 12px;" border="0" cellspacing="8">

                    <td>
                        Search for records containing <i>xxx</i> in any of the data fields.

                        Search for records that have a count of <i>xxx</i> values in field <i>abc</i>. Also use 
                        <span class="search_term">fc:<i>abc</i>:<i>&gt;xxx</i></span> or 
                        <span class="search_term">fc:<i>abc</i>:<i>xxx&lt;&gt;yyy</i></span> for ranges.<span></span>
                        <br>                        
                        <b>"field"</b> can be shortened to "<b>f</b>". The field identifier <i>abc</i> may be the name of the field, for example
                        <span class="search_term">field:"AuthorEditor":Hill</span>,
                        or the field's numerical identifier, <span class="search_term">field:196:Hill</span>.
                        <br>The numerical identifier is preferred, since the name must be the base field name which is often difficult to determine.
                        <br>
                        <b>=</b>, <b>&lt;</b> and <b>&gt;</b> operators may be used, e.g.
                        <span class="search_term">f:123=456</span>, <span class="search_term">f:"date added"&lt;yesterday</span>.
                        <br>Less than and greater than can also be used with text fields, so the following will retrieve all records
                        with a name/title field (field 1) starting with "B" <span class="search+term">f:1&gt;B f:1&lt;C</span>

                        <!-- For a list of field IDs and names, click here [TO BE CREATED].  -->

        <h4>Geographic search</h4>

        Searches for records with geographic objects use the <b>latitude</b> and <b>longitude</b> search terms.
        These may be used in conjunction with the <b>=</b>, <b>&lt;</b> and <b>&gt;</b> modifiers.

                        "r" (rating) and "p" (popularity) (the full words can also be used);
                        " rating" is the user's personal rating of the record (nubmer of stars),
                        "popularity" indicates how many times each record has been bookmarked;
                        or <i>sortby:field:abc</i> / <i>sortby:field:abc:m</i>
                        <ul>
                            <li><i>abc</i> is the numerical identifier of a field (internally,
                                bib_detail.bdt_id). Note that <i>field</i> can be abbreviated to <i>f</i></li>
                            <li>the optional <i>m</i> (multiple) parameter causes records to be displayed in more

                                For example, the normal behaviour where there are multiple authors is to

        <h4>Advanced functions</h4>

        <h5>Retrieving specific records</h5>

        <p>The Heurist search engine can be asked to retrieve a specific set of
            records by supplying their Heurist IDs:</p>

        <table style="font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 12px;" border="0" cellspacing="8">

                    <td>
                        where xxx is a comma-separated list of internal record IDs (the unique

                </tr></tbody>
        </table>



        <h5>Retrieving relationships and pointers</h5>

        <p>
            Retrieve the set of records which are pointed to within the public
            information of a record (eg. all the authors listed for a paper, all the
            projects listed for an organisation), which point to a record in their public
            information, or which are connected with a record by
            relationship records:

                        set of records which have pointers (in their public information) TO this record

        <h5>Search URL parameters</h5>

        <p>
            The Advanced Search window, and the search field, are simply convenient ways
            of entering information which is converted into a search URL such as <a href=".../q=tag:Favourites&amp;w=bookmark">/q=tag:Favourites&amp;w=bookmark</a>.
        </p>


        <p>
            Search URLs can be entered directly, for example if one wishes to construct a
            hyperlink in a web page which will bring up a particualr Heurist search. There
            is a fairly straightforward translation from search string to URL which can be
            worked out by doing some searches and comparing the string with the URL. The
            following parameters, though, are less obvious, and are listed here for those
            who wish to use this feature.
        </p>

        <table style="font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 12px;" border="0" cellspacing="8">

                        are displayed (if omitted the search fields continue to display the search
                        criteria). Clearing the fields is useful when one will most likely
                        immediately type a different search, as in the case of the default
                        Favourites search which is run when Heurist is loaded.</td>

        <h4>Further examples</h4>

        <p>
            If multiple search terms are provided, their effect is ANDed -
            Heurist returns only the records matching all the search terms.<br>
            For example, searching <span class="search_term">tag:timelines tag:mapping</span> matches only records that have been marked with
            the tag <b>timelines</b> and the tag <b>mapping</b>.
        </p>

        <p>
            Entire phrases can be matched by enclosing them in double-quotes.
            For example, searching <span class="search_term">"sydney university"</span> will match all records with a title containing
            "sydney university" in that order, as a complete phrase; whereas searching <span class="search_term">sydney university</span>
            (without the double-quotes) will match records with both <b>sydney</b> and <b>university</b>, anywhere in the title,
            such as "University of New South Wales, Sydney".
        </p>

        <p>
            To find records matching either of two search terms, add an uppercase OR between the terms.
            For example, searching <span class="search_term">tag:timelines OR tag:mapping</span> matches records that have been marked with
            either of the <b>timelines</b> or <b>mapping</b> tags.
        </p>

        <p>
            Resources matching a term may be omitted from the results by preceding the term with a minus sign.
            For example, searching <span class="search_term">university -url:usyd.edu.au</span> matches any record which has <b>university</b>
            in the title, and does not have <b>usyd.edu.au</b> in the URL.
        </p>
