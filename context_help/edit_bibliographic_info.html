<h2>Edit - Bibliographic Info</h2>
<hr>

<h4>Why use it?</h4>

<p>The third tab in the Edit page provides a flexible data entry interface 
allowing the entry of typed bibliographic resources, with distinct sets of entry 
fields. Resources may be owned by parent resources eg. chapters by books, or 
books by series and series by publishers. Data entry at up to five levels occurs 
within a seamless interface, with predictive search into the database to 
identify existing records (eg. discovery of an existing record for a journal 
article, lookup of a journal, publication details for a book series).</p>

<p>The editing and data structuring capability of Heurist has already surpassed 
most commercial systems, as of March 2006, and we wil lbe streamlining certain 
aspects - notably author handling and container reference lookup and 
disambiguation - over the next few months.</p>

<h4>How to use it</h4>

<p>For a resource with container resources, such as a journal article (contained 
in a volume of a journal, perhaps belonging to a series), you will see two or 
more headings bars listing the resource and its containers. The first heading 
bar includes a pulldown list of reference types, the others change according to 
the reference type selected. Below the first heading bar, the fields appropriate 
to this reference type will be displayed in editing mode (data entry fields with 
information about what is expected on the right).</p>

<p>Tab between data fields. Each field indicates if it is required, recommended 
or optional. An insertion icon on the right of a repeating field allows the 
insertion of an extra value for that field (authors for example should be 
entered one to a line). After entering data for the top level resource, hit the 
Save button. The next level will open up (if applicable, and if in first time 
entry mode).</p>

<p>Predictive search is currently carried out on change of field, so it is worth 
typing one or two words into author or title and tabbing to the next field to 
see if the system finds the resource you are entering. If so, it can be inserted 
by clicking the left arrow against its title in the panel on the right, and the 
edit fields will close and be replaced by display-only fields. You can edit the 
resource details by clicking Edit Details.</p>

<p><u>Constructed titles</u>: The title of each resource, whether top level or 
container, is constructed automatically from a concatenation of the fields 
entered, using a concatentation mask defined by the system adminstrators - for 
example, books end up with a constructed title consisting of the title entered, 
authors/editors and year, suitably punctuated. These constructed titles do not 
replace the reference title entered, they are simply used to provide a more 
informative title in search results (&quot;Analytical Archaeology, Clarke, D.L. 
1978&quot;, for example, rather than just &quot;Analytical Archaeology&quot;). Constructed 
titles are not used for bibliographic output, which goes back to the original 
title entered. If you feel that the constructed titles generated are not 
appropriate, let us know, as it's a two minute job to change it if we agree. 
Constructed titles can also be edited, but they will revert to a new constructed 
title if the bibliographic record is edited.</p>

<p><u>Editing container resources</u>: When a resource is in display-only mode, 
it will have a link on the righthand side of its title bar which reads &quot;Bookmark 
this resource&quot; or &quot;Edit this resource&quot;. Bookmarking the resource adds a bookmark 
to it in your personal space (My References), which makes it easy for you to 
find and edit it. Editing the resource allows you to edit both your personal 
view of it (the Personal Info tab) and the shared view (Public Info tab). </p>

<p><u>Deleting bookmarks</u>:You can delete the bookmark to, say, a journal, 
from My References without deleting it from the database - deleting it will not 
alter any journal article references which refer to it. However alterations to 
the bibliographic information WILL be carried through to any resources which 
reference it.</p>

<p><u>Changing reference type</u>: You can change reference type from the 
pulldown. The set of fields displayed will change, and Heurist will do its best 
to reallocate your data to equivalent fields in the new reference type (if they 
exist). It does not lose data which is not displayed until you actually save the 
record, so you can revert or change to another reference type and recover data 
which has disappeared (because there was no field to hold it in the intermediate 
type).</p>
