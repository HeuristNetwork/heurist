<body>

<p><strong>This is a placeholder for the Heurist Help system</strong></p>

<p>Please ask your system administrator to copy the Heurist help files distributed on the
Open Source website into the /help folder of this Heurist installation.</p>

<p>We recommend placing the help files folder in the HEURIST_SUPPORT directory in the parent directory of the Heurist installation
- often a HEURIST directory in the root web directory - and simlinking this folder as /help in the Heurist installation.
This allows the same help files to be shared across multiple Heurist installations on the server
(eg. different versions and/or customisations). This is the way Heurist is normally set up if the Heurist installation script is used.</p>
