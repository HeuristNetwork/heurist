                <b>Explore</b> is the workhorse function that allows you to make use of the data recorded in a database*
                The core function of <b>Explore</b> is filtering the database to isolate a subset of the database to which some sort of listing, analysis, visualisation or export will be applied (filter also acts as a simple search to locate information to look through eg. a reference, web bookmark or images). This workflow, from filter through results list or subset to reading, visualization, analysis and output, is represented in the left-to-right flow across the Explore screen â€“ filter building and saved filters on the left, results listing in the middle, and various visualisations and outputs on the right. 
            </p>

                <i>* If you don't yet have any data in this  database you are first going to need Design and Populate</i>
