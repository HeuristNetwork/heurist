<h3>Please help us to help you!</h3>

<br/>&nbsp;<br/>
<p>The Heurist interface is in rapid development, although the underlying database model and data engine are entirely stable. We apply an 'extreme programming' methodology, making small incremental improvements and bug-fixes on a day-to-day basis. That means we can fix any issues you report, often within a few hours.</p>

<br/>
<p>Please let us know <u>immediately</u> of any problem you encounter, however small — contact details in the Help menu above. Problems can include anything which doesn't work, any workflow which is confusing or awkward, any step which isn't clear.</p>

<br/>
<p>Please don't wait until the issue becomes annoying — you are not 'bothering' us in any way with small (or large) problems; rather, you are helping us understand where other users might also have a problem, so that we can tweak or enhance the interface or fix any underlying problem.</p>

<br/>
<p>If Heurist seems confusing at first — it can be difficult to see how it fits your domain because the capabilities are so generic — drop us a line and we will be happy to help you get started; it will soon fall into place.</p>
