<h3>Please help us help you!</h3>

<p>We operate in 'continuous beta'. That means that we make small incremental improvements and bug-fixes on an almost daily basis.</p>

<p>That means you may occasionally encounter small glitches in the interface*</p>

<p>The other side of the coin is that we can, and do, fix bugs often in a matter of hours.</p>

<p>So if you encounter a problem - either something which doesn't work or an issue of workflow or some step which isn't clear or you simply don't understand how it works - please shoot us an email immediately. </p>

<p>Don't wait until the issue bugs you. You are not 'bothering' us in any way with small problems, you are helping us understand where other users might also have a problem so that we can tweak, or fix, the interface.</p>

* our underlying database model and data engine are entirely stable
