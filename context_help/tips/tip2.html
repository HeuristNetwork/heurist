<h3>Designing your database</h3>

<br/>
<p>Each new database is set up with pre-configured set of widely-used and useful record types (entities), such as Person, Organisation, Place, Event, Web page, Digital media item and Note, as well as standard bibliographic and mapping record types, along with all the fields and vocabularies (term/category lists) they require. At the very least this is a huge time-saver and also encourages use of shared standards; in some cases this could be all you need. </p><br/>

<p>Every element can be customised through the modification and addition of fields, or deleted if not required. New record types, fields and terms can be created from scratch or borrowed from existing databases, including special template databases curated by the Heurist team.</p>

<br/>
<ul>

<li><b>Borrow (Templates)</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Manage | Structure | <i>Templates</i>
<br/>&nbsp;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Browse a list of databases registered with the Heurist clearinghouse to find useful record types (entities), fields and vocabularies (terms).<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first few databases in the list are a (growing) set of curated structures which are likely to be of use in specific domains.

<li><b>Adapt (Organise)</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Manage | Structure | <i>Organise</i>
<br/>&nbsp;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This will allow you to add, delete and modify the record types (entities) in the database, organise them into related<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;groups, add and modify the fields (attributes) you record, and define the terms used to populate dropdowns.

</li>

<li><b>Connect (Visualise)</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Manage | Structure | <i>Visualise</i>
<br/>&nbsp;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Provides a visual representation of the links between different record types (entities) and allows the creation of<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;new links between entities. Fields in a record type can also be added, edited and deleted from this view.

<li><b>Adding data</b>
<br/>&nbsp;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no need to wait until your database structure is complete. You can start adding data immediately<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and return repeatedly to add to and modify the structure without losing existing data.<br/>
