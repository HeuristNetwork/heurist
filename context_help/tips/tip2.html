<h3>Tip 2: Please help us to help you!</h3>

<p>Heurist is in rapid development. We apply an 'extreme programming' methodology, making small incremental improvements and bug-fixes on a day-to-day basis.
</p>

<p>Our underlying database model and data engine are entirely stable, but you may occasionally catch a glitch in the interface that we have missed.
</p>

<p>PLEASE let us know immediately of any problem you encounter*, however small (contact details in Help menu above).
</p>

<p>Please don't wait until the issue becomes annoying â€” you are not 'bothering' us in any way with small (or large) problems; rather, you are helping us understand where other users might also have a problem, so that we can tweak or enhance the interface or fix any underlying problem.
</p>

<p>If Heurist seems confusing at first - it can be difficult to see how it fits your domain because the capabilities are so generic - drop us a line and we will be happy to help you get started; it will soon fall into place.
</p>

<p>* including something which doesn't work, any workflow which is confusing or awkward, any step which isn't clear, .
