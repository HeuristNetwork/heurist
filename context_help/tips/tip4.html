<h3>Using the data</h3>

<br/>
<p>The basic workflow for using Heurist data is to <b><a href="http://heurist.sydney.edu.au/help/Find.html">filter</a></b> the database, which creates a subset of records, then generate output from those records. Output can be to the screen: a list of the filtered subset of database records in the centre panel, and various visualisations, reports and analysis in the righthand panel; or it can be printed or embedded (dynamically updated) in a web site.</p><br/>

<p>Heurist provides a sophisticated set of filter capabilities - simple, text-based, categories, fuzzy matching, facet searches, spatial and temporal searches - along with the ability to create <b><a href="http://heurist.sydney.edu.au/help/RuleSets.html">rules</a></b> which extend the search results outwards through a network of linked records. Filter criteria and rules can be saved for re-use in a navigation tree in the lefthand panel.</p>

<li><b>Visualisation</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Map-Timeline & Network Diagram</i>
<br/>&nbsp;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A map and timeline is generated automatically for any result set which contains spatial and/or date information. More sophisticated<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;control of the map can be obtained by defining records for Map Documents, Map Layers and Map Data Sources. The results set can also<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be viewed as a network diagram showing all the records and the connections between them.

<li><b>Reporting</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Custom reports</i>
<br/>&nbsp;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;User-defined reports are easily built using the widely-used Smarty templating language. Dropdowns insert required<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;code snippets and results are easily previewed. There are a wide range of sophisticated functions including data<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;formatting, numerical operations, aggregation, conditional execution and custom functions.

<li><b>Exporting files</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Export</i>
<br/>&nbsp;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Filtered results can be easily exported to XML (single or multi-file with manifest), CSV, KML and custom report formats.

<li><b>Descriptive stats</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Crosstabs</i>
<br/>&nbsp;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We don't aim to duplicate statistics packages but provide a data tabulation function for up to three dimensions.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tabulation includes row and column totals and percentages. For other statistics we recommend a package such as R.

</li>

<li><b>Populating web sites</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br/>&nbsp;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of the output functions give you the html and/or javascript code necessary to embed the results in a web page.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This code is generally compatible with Wordpress and institutional CMS sites, and can be simply be pasted in where required.
