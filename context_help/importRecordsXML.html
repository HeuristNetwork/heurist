<p>This function imports an XML or JSON file generated by Heurist using Export > XML (HML schema) or Export > JSON. 
The source database must first be registered with Database > Register (only the database owner or the system administrator 
can register a database). This is required so that the target database can import the structural elements required from 
the source database and can download files (eg. images) from it. Registration of the target database is not required.</p>

<p>You can also import an XML file constructed according to the XML template generated by Import > Download XML template. The template ensures that all data in the file fits the schema of the database. If the database is registered before exporting the template, the data can be imported into any Heurist database. If the source database is not registered, the template is specific to the database from which it is written (or other databases with the required schema elements). Registration of the target database is not required.</p>
