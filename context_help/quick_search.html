<h2>Quick search</h2>
<hr>

<h4>Why use it?</h4>

<p>Google, move over ... really ! Quick Search is your first port of call for anything not in your Favourites 
list or saved searches. If you get used to using Quick Search, you will soon 
find yourself using it for everything not on your home page - you are just a 
click or so away from anything you use regularly, and a click away from a Google 
search on the same terms.</p>

<p>For example, find everything to do with the University's Spendvision system 
simply by typing <b>spend</b>, anything to do with Angkor by typing <b>angk</b>,&nbsp; 
most things to do with the University of Sydney by typing <b>usyd</b>. If it's 
not in the system (and academic references will increasingly be already in the 
syetem) click on the Web tab to send the same search to Google.</p>

<h4>How to use it</h4>

<p>Use a single word - or even part of a word - to rapidly find anything in your 
bookmarks (or anyone's bookmarks) by searching titles.</p>

<p>Use distinctive bits of words in any order. To find Sydney travel pages use
<b>syd trav </b>or <b>trav syd</b>. Enclose words in &quot; &quot; to search for specific 
phrases.</p>

<p>The tabs across the top of the page repeat the Quick search across the 
references you've bookmarked (<b>My References)</b>, all references in the 
system bookmarked by anyone (<b>All References</b>)<b> </b>and via a Google 
search of the web <b>(Web</b>)<b>. </b></p>

<p>Note: Google searches on whole words only - 'syd trav' gets 62K hits, 'sydney 
travel' gets 45M hits.</p>

<h4>Be quick ...</h4>

<p>Don't bother clicking the <b>Find</b> button, just hit <b>Enter</b> after 
typing the word(s).</p>

<p>If the search retrieves too much, just type another word (the cursor will 
still be in the Quick Search field) and hit Enter to narrow the search.</p>

<h4>Future plans</h4>

<p>We are undecided whether to make this a search across all data or to keep it 
as a title-only search. We would appreciate your feedback. Our word-fragment 
title search is a very effective rapid search, searching all fields would return 
broader, less focused lists. We like it this way, but will change it if the 
weight of opinion is for a broader search.</p>

<h3>See also</h3>

<p><b>Saved searches: </b>After doing any search, you can save it as a
<a href="saved_searches.html">saved search</a>, which will show up as a 
hyperlink on your HEURIST home page for immediate repeat access (the search is 
repeated, so new resources will be included).</p>

<p><b>Live bookmarks</b>: In recent browsers (Firefox 1.5 and above) the results 
of a search can be inserted as a live bookmark in your browser links toolbar. 
When clicked, the results of the search will appear as a pulldown list of links.</p>
