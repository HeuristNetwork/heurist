<div><strong>New Record</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>This function creates a new empty record, ready for data entry. This is the primary means by which a database is populated manually by the users. By default, the type of record created will be the same as the most recently created record. This default record type appears in square brackets; in this example, the default type is [Person].</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Clicking New directly creates a record of the default type. A popup appears in which you can immediately begin entering data.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
    <div>Hovering over New opens the Add Record slide tray showing the available record types in the database. To create a new record of a particular type, simply click on that record type.</div>
    <div>&nbsp;</div>
    <div><img src="context_help/assets/add-record-list.png" alt="Add Record - list of record types" /></div>
    <div>&nbsp;</div>
</div>
<div>Fields in bold red type are mandatory fields, which must be filled in order for the new record to be saved. The checking the box Optional fields allows you to see and fill in additional fields in the records. There are range of options for editing both the record and also change the structure of the record (Modify Structure in the top left corner). It is not recommended to modify the structure of records unless you are an experienced user and have a good reason for doing so. In the bottom banner, there are several options for saving the current new record and then taking other actions: duplicating the record again (Dupe), creating a fresh new record (New), save the current record but remain editing it (Save), save the current record and close it (Save + Close), and close the current record without saving it (Drop Changes).</div>
<div>Upload Files</div>
<div>Delimited text / CSV Delimited text upload is the primary means for populating your database with bulk data. This tool is used to parse delimited text, comma-separated or tab-separated variable (CSV or TSV) data, and then organise that data into structures that are compatible with Heurist. The import tool is a very powerful way to populate your database, but it can be a complex process. It is important that the data is as clean as possible, prior to import. If you are unsure about any step in the import process, please consult the Heurist Help System, watch the walkthrough video, or contact User Support. There are three ways to begin using the Import tool: &bull; Upload new file &ndash; an existing CSV or TSV file from your desktop &bull; Select previously uploaded file &ndash; these files appear in a dropdown menu &bull; Paste delimited data below &ndash; you can paste data directly from the clipboard Please observe the conventions for representing data, including using column labels in the first line, proper line terminations, quotes, and special symbols. These are explained in the help sidebar, and also in a dedicated page in the Help System.</div>
<div>Zotero Bibliography Sync This tool allows you to automatically synchronise a Zotero web library with the bibliography structure within Heurist. It is especially powerful because it allows you update bibliographic data from an active Zotero library, thereby saving time and effort in updating bibliography records within Heurist. To use the Bibliography Sync function, you first need to define a connection to a Zotero Library. If this has not yet been done, in your database, you will be prompted to edit the settings that establishing such a Zotero connection. The relevant field is Zotero web library key(s) and IDs for synchronisation. For further information on how to obtain the relevant key(s), see <a href="zotero.html">this reference</a>. [We should probably fix the problems before continuing to write this help text]</div>
<div>Heurist XML / JSon This allows data to be imported into an XML or Json format that is specially tailored for compatibility with Heurist. When preparing data in this format, it is strongly recommended to first download the XML template. This is an XML document (HML schema) that presents the core definitions of records that are necessary for proper functioning of your database. Following this template, you can design an XML document that can be easily read by Heurist. Once an HML or JSon-format is ready, select the file to upload from your desktop. Doing this takes you to a screen where the data is parsed and check. This screen enumerates the records to be imported and asks for final confirmation before the data is imported to create new records. Click Import Records to start the import.</div>
<div>KML This tool is designed specifically for the import of bulk geospatial data into Heurist. In order to use this tool, first prepare a KML document in the standard format. Note that popular mapping tools such as Google Earth and Google Maps are able to natively export geospatial data in KML format. Once the KML document is ready, upload it from your desktop either into the Upload new file (KML) field, or else Select previously uploaded field from the dropdown menu. Heurist then parses the KML file and extracts certain basic fields to be imported into records. The KML Import tool then attempts to analyse the data. It is usually necessary to direct Heurist to the appropriate identifier and date columns, in order for it to correctly interpret the data. After data analysis, you will be prompted to select the primary Target record type. This determines the type of record that will be created to house the geospatial data of the KML file. Click OK to complete the import and create the new records. Like all automated import processes, KML import requires clean data and careful use. If you are unsure of any aspect of the process, seek help from User Support before proceeding. For more information on KML, see <a href="kml_import.html">this reference</a></div>
<div>Media Files</div>
<div>Upload media files This function, designed for use by Database Managers only, allows you to upload media files directly onto the Heurist server for use with a particular database. There are a range of allowable file formats/extension that can be uploaded in bulk in this way. As a Database Manager, you can select a media/upload folder in the relevant directory on the Heurist server. After selecting the target folder within this directory, Add Files from the desktop to upload. Once selected, Start uploads in order to begin the process of copying these media files onto the server. Once completed, close the pane by clicking Finished.</div>
<div>Index media files This function, which is reserved for advanced users only, generates an index for bulk uploaded files and writes this metadata as Digital media items in the database, with pointers back to the indexed files. Before using this function, be sure to specify the correct media/file folders by clicking the link. Be sure to check the Folders to scan before proceeding. Click Continue to commence the indexing process. Once completed, you will be given a report summarising the outcome of the indexing and any other issues.</div>
<div>Website</div>
<div>Create This is the first step to setting up a website for your database. When clicked, this function will show you a dialog box to check whether you wish to proceed and to give the option of keeping the website private. Clicking Yes will automatically generate a set of CMS (content management system) records in your database, which form the basis of your website. You will be routed directly to the Website Editor pane. This presents your website as it appears to general users (unless if you have chosen to hide the website).</div>
<div>Edit The Website Editor pane allows you to directly edit your website as it appears. When the website is first created, it will present a set of pages with default content, ready for you to modify and add your own content. There are two ways to edit the content of a particular web page within your website: Edit page content (which opens a WYSIWYG editor) and Edit page source (which opens a HTML source editor). Both are very useful, but we recommend that beginners start with the WYSIWYG editor. There are certain features of a Heurist website, such as the built-in widgets, that are easier to implement in the WYSIWYG editor than in the Source editor. The sidebar of the Website Editor has a number of important tools: &bull; Website header / layout opens an editing page for the CMS_Home record, which governs the appearance of the Home Page and the structure of the rest of the website. Editing this record allows you to edit the header that appears on each page, including adding a website logo and title. It also allows you to choose and arrange the top level menus that appear in the banner just below the header. You can also add content to the front page, and advanced users can modify the website CSS and add custom Javascript to the website. &bull; Main Menu is an alternative way to modify the structure of your website. You can add and drag menu items, as well as creating submenus. These structural changes are immediately implemented on your website. &bull; Custom header &amp; footer are tools for advanced users only. They allow you to manually write HTML for the website&rsquo;s headers and footers. &bull; Edit page content opens the WYSIWYG editor for the current web page &bull; Edit page source opens the HTML source editor for the current web page &bull; Refresh reloads the whole website, in order to implement the latest changes &bull; Preview site opens the website, as it appears to the general public, in a separate window/tab. How your website appears here is not a draft, it is the published version itself. &bull; Close editor returns you to the main Publish pane. &bull; View opens your website in a new window/tab. If you are running a development version of Heurist (e.g. /h6-alpha/), you will be given two options: &bull; View Current (development) version, which means that all the latest development features of the database will be available for use on the website. A website produced in this manner should NOT be publicly disseminated, because the development version of the software is liable to rapid change and development. &bull; View Production version, which means that all the current production version of Heurist will be used. This option is best for publishing websites that are stable, tested, and suitable for public viewing. &bull; Standalone web page allows you to create a website that stands alone and can be embedded in an external website.</div>
<div>Export &bull; CSV is a tool for exporting records to comma-separated (CSV) or tab-separated (TSV) text files. The tool prompts you to select: &bull; the Records scope to be exported &bull; the Fields to export from all records in that scope &bull; the Field delimiter and type of quotemark &bull; a few checkboxes for how to represent pointers and terms &bull; There follow tools for exporting the records in your current record set into 5 different formats: XML, JSON, GeoJSON, KML, GEPHI. For each of these formats, you are given four options for how to deal with connections between records (pointers and relationships). For most purposes, you should follow the recommended option #1. The other options carry the risk of either excluding or including too much data.</div>
<div>&bull; The Archive package option is available only to database administrators. It allows you to export the whole database as a fully self-documenting Heurist XML (HML) file.</div>
