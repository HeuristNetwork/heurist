<h2>Tags</h2>
<hr>

<h4>Why use them?</h4>

<p>Tags allow you to find resources on particular topics through a search, 
but also serve to mark specific subsets of your bookmarks which you want to use 
in different situations. You might use a tag to identify the resources for a 
class reading list, for a research project, for a paper in preparation or for 
extra-curricular activities such as travel or events.</p>

<h4>How to use them</h4>

<p>Enter all or part of a tag in the tags search field. The search does 
partial tag matching, so it is OK to enter a distinctive substring such as &quot;trav&quot; 
rather than &quot;travel&quot;. </p>

<p>Tag search also works across other people's tags, allowing you to 
discover resources that other people have taged with predictable terms - for 
example, search for &quot;history&quot; or &quot;map&quot; or for widely used but more specialist 
terms such as &quot;chronology&quot; or &quot;GIS&quot;.</p>

<h4>How to create them</h4>

<p>Enter tags, separated by commas, in the tag field in the Private Info 
tab of the Edit page. Unlike many systems, multi-word tags are permitted. Do 
not enter commas in a tag, of course ...</p>

<p>If any of the tags you enter are not recognised, a disambiguation window 
will pop up when you try and save the record. This will suggest existing 
tags that you might have meant (to reduce the proliferation of tags 
through typos and punctuation differences - Heurist ignores capitalisation and 
spacing differences) and also allows you to edit the text of the new tags or 
omit them altogether. It then rewrites the tag string with the changes you 
have made. </p>

<p>In other places in the system, Heurist will display a pulldown list of all 
the tags you've used, allowing selection from the list. In the confiuration 
page, all your tags are displayed with frequency of use.</p>

<p>You can edit the text of a tag without detaching it from any bookmarks 
you have taged with it. So if you change &quot;History&quot; to &quot;Historical Studies&quot;, 
all the bookmarks taged &quot;History&quot; will now be taged &quot;Historical 
Studies&quot;.</p>

<h4>Future plans</h4>

<p>Additional use of pulldown lists of existing tags to insert tags 
during editing and search. We don't currently do this everywhere to avoid 
cluttering up the screen. Sorting of tags by frequency of use will also be 
introduced as an option in pulldowns.</p>

<p>The configuration page allows deletion and editing of tags, but this will 
be extended with merging of tags, and made more easily accessible with a 
link wherever tags are used. </p>

<h3>See also</h3>

<p><b>Live bookmarks</b>: In recent browsers (Firefox 1.5 and above) the results 
of a search can be inserted as a live bookmark in your browser links toolbar. 
When clicked, the results of the search will appear as a pulldown list of links. 
This is very useful for saving searches on particualr tags.</p>
