                <b>Explore</b> is the workhorse function that allows you to make use of the data recorded in a database*
                The core function of <b>Explore</b> is filtering the database to isolate a subset of the database to which some sort of listing, analysis, visualisation or export will be applied (filter also acts as a simple search to locate information to look through eg. a reference, web bookmark or images). This workflow, from filter through results list or subset to reading, visualization, analysis and output, is represented in the left-to-right flow across the Explore screen – filter building and saved filters on the left, results listing in the middle, and various visualisations and outputs on the right. 
            </p>

                    <h3>Filter builder</h3>
                    <p>
                        The Filter builder provides an easy way of building queries of moderate complexity. Simple searches, such as a partial string match on title, can be entered directly in the filter fields or constructed with the Filter builder.         
                        <img src="context_help/assets/explore-search.png" style="width:500px;padding:15px;"/> 
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <h3>Facet filters and rule sets</h3>
                    <p>
                        Heurist has a very sophisticated system for building facet filters (on-the-fly searches) and rules. 
                        The facets builder is not restricted to building facets on the attributes (fields) of a single selected entity type. It can drill down into the connections between entity types to allow selection on the attributes of related records at several levels removed. The choices are made from a treeview of attributes which can be expanded to view the attributes of connected entity types.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The facet builder can also apply rules to traverse the network of connections to find entities which are connected to the results of a facet filter. Rulesets can be created and used independently.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        These queries – built on the fly - allow a range of sophisticated instant analyses, without programming, along the lines of “select all the organisations which have published books written by female authors who have degrees from a University located in London”. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Facet filters can be embedded into websites generated by the Heurist CMS.
                    </p>
                </div>
            </div>        


            <div style="min-height:375px">
                <img src="context_help/assets/explore-filter-list.png" style="float:left;width:190px;padding:0px 15px;"/>
                <div>
                    <h3>Saved filters and rules</h3>
                    <p>
                        Heurist allows the saving of filter criteria which become entries in a tree of saved filters, accessible through Saved filters and Rules menu entries, and in a dropdown below the Filter button. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Saved filters can be simply a predefined filter which generates a given subset of the database for a specific purpose (eg. sets of things you need regularly, perhaps sorted in a specific order, or a list to be displayed in a website), or they can be facet filters (which will be familiar from online shopping sites) which provide a guided pathway allowing interactive exploration of the database through the display of subsets with frequency of occurrence according to the selections made. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Saved filters (simple or facet) and rules can also be created directly from the list of saved filters by clicking on the rollover icon or right-clicking on the list. The dropdown menu also allows the creation of folders within the list, editing and deletion, and other functions. Filters can be moved by drag and drop.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Note also that saved filters and rules are organized by workgroup, to allow database managers to create different sets of filters for different groups of users – for example the filters needed by volunteer data collectors or filters to be displayed on a CMS website (a Website Filters workgroup is defined by default for this purpose). 
                    </p>

                    <h3>Entities</h3>
                    <p>
                        This is shortcut for filtering the database to a specific entity (record) type. Two lists of entity types are shown: a Favourites list configured by the user, and a list of all record types used in the database in order of frequency of occurrence. 
                    </p>
                </div>
            </div>

                <div>
                    <h3>Set as subset</h3>
                    <p>
                        This menu item restricts further filtering to the current result set. This can be useful to isolate a specific set of records for further filtering, visualisation or analysis eg. all the records from a specific collection or all the works by a specific set of authors. Once set, the subset can be cancelled with the undo icon which appears at the end of the menu item.
