<h3>Why should I make Heurist my home page?</h3>

<p>Heurist is designed to load rapidly and provide you immediate access to your most commonly used web sites, references and notes (and other resources). It will find your less commonly used resources with a rapid Google-like search. It even incorporates a Google tab for searching the web. You will never need another home page or browser bookmarks!</p>

<h3>How do I make Heurist my home page?</h3>

<ul>
 <li>Drag the "Heurist home page" link to the Home button of your browser;</li>
 <li>If this doesn't work: open Tools &gt; Options or Tools &gt; Internet Options
 and insert the following as your home page address: http://heuristscholar.org</li>
 <li>If you aren't (yet) prepared to make Heurist your home page, drag the link to your Bookmarks or Links toolbar.</li>
</ul>

<p>Note: You can rename the link after adding to the toolbar by right clicking and selecting Properties.</p>
