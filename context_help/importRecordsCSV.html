            <h4>Sub Header 1</h4>
            
        This function loads a comma-separated or tab-separated text file, such as those generated by many spreadsheets and databases, allowing
        matching of rows against existing data based on one or more columns eg. name(s), dates, identifiers. Unmatched rows can be added as new records.
            
            <h4>Sub Header 2</h4>

            <p>
        The process can be repeated on the file to extract multiple entities from different columns and replace them with record IDs which can be<br />
        used in a subsequent insertion or update of records.
            </p>
            <p>
        The first line MUST contain column labels. Do it for your own sanity!<br />
        Data rows must occupy a single line of data terminated with a CRLF (Windows) or an LF (Unix/Mac).<br />
        Linefeeds within memo fields should be represented by CR only. Fields should be separated by tab or comma.<br />
        Quotes may exist within unquoted fields, but within quoted fields they should be preceded by a backslash ( \" ).<br />
        Fields containing the field separator should be enclosed in quotes.
            </p>

        Editors such as <a href="http://notepad-plus-plus.org/" target="_blank">Notepad++</a>
        (free, Open Source, Windows) show tabs, CR and LF as symbols and can do global replacements on them.
