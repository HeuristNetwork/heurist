        This function loads a comma-separated or tab-separated text file, such as those generated by many spreadsheets and databases, allowing
        matching of rows against existing data based on one or more columns eg. name(s), dates, identifiers. Unmatched rows can be added as new records.
            </p>

Importing all but the simplest spreadsheet is a complex business. It is important to clean up the data as much as possible in advance, so that there is one row per entry and columns contain a single element of data (split concatenated values into separate columns; place notes about data items in a separate column, not appended to the data value). Coded columns should use a consistent set of codes. In addition to your spreadsheet program, you may find OpenRefine (<a href="http://openrefine.org" target="_blank">http://openrefine.org</a>) a useful tool for checking and correcting coded columns, splitting fields, georeferencing, finding URL references and so forth.

We strongly suggest editing the structure of the database to add any fields and terms that you will require for the import, before attempting to load the data. If you start trying to load data without the appropriate fields in place you will find it frustrating having to exit the process repeatedly to add fields.
            </p>
            <p>
If you have missing data for Required fields, you may find it convenient to set those fields to Optional before importing, then set them back to Required, then use Database > Verify Structure and Data to get a list of the records which need correcting. Alternatively you will need to add some dummy value to the data, such as 'Missing', and search for this value after import.

            <p>
        The process can be repeated on the file to extract multiple entities from different columns and replace them with record IDs which can be<br />
        used in a subsequent insertion or update of records.
            </p>
            <p>
        The first line MUST contain column labels. Do it for your own sanity!<br />
        Data rows must occupy a single line of data terminated with a CRLF (Windows) or an LF (Unix/Mac).<br />
        Linefeeds within memo fields should be represented by CR only. Fields should be separated by tab or comma.<br />
        Quotes may exist within unquoted fields, but within quoted fields they should be preceded by a backslash ( \" ).<br />
        Fields containing the field separator should be enclosed in quotes.

        Editors such as <a href="http://notepad-plus-plus.org/" target="_blank">Notepad++</a>
        (free, Open Source, Windows) show tabs, CR and LF as symbols and can do global replacements on them.
