<b>Teaching and research interests:&nbsp;</b>
<div hdetail="191" hrecord="64584">Over the past thirty years I have developed a global and interdisciplinary perspective in Archaeology, that integrates research, teaching and service. My fields of expertise are the theory and philosophy of archaeology, the study of settlement growth and decline and the analysis of large-scale cultural phenomena over time. In 1995 I published The Limits of Settlement Growth: a theoretical outline - an analysis of the past 15,000 years of settlement-growth and decline - with Cambridge University Press. I have an international reputation as a radical theorist and as the instigator of the Greater Angkor Project, which derives from my theoretical work and is part of a major research program in Cambodia. As well as teaching across a wide spectrum of archaeology, I have initiated new teaching programs in the Archaeology of Asia and have taught a generation of diverse, innovative professional archaeologists. My combination of teaching and research has created a multi-disciplinary research team of local and international research students and staff, linking the Humanities and the Sciences. This program of research on Angkor has developed international collaborations for the University and has enhanced its public profile through media presentations, such as the National Geographic International TV program &ldquo;Lost City&rdquo;. The Angkor research team also serves the intentional community through the applied research of the Living with Heritage Project at Angkor, in collaboration with the Cambodian government and UNESCO.</div>

My main, current project is an ARC-funded, joint investigation of the Mamasani district in southwestern Iran. This is being run together with the Iranian Center of Archaeological Research, part of the Iranian Cultural Heritage &amp; Tourism Organization and involves two of my former students, Dr. Cameron Petrie (Cambridge University) and Dr. Lloyd Weeks (Univ. of Nottingham). Technically, the project has been funded for the period 2002-2006 but due to various bureaucratic problems we have not been able to excavate at our two main stratified sites, Tol-e Nurabad and Tol-e Spid, since 2003 and funds are being carried forward, which should prolong this phase of the project. A major monograph on the results of two stratigraphic probes is due to be published later in 2006. We have three dozen C14 dates and a sequence extending from c. 6000 B.C. to the time of Christ</div>
