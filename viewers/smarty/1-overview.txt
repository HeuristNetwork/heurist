Notes:      Smarty templates are to a large degree a replacement for the XSL templates

            Unlike the printview templates, Smarty templates can be edited through the Heurist
            web interface. Although they use internal codes to define variables, routines are
            provided to translate a Smarty templte to global concept codes and vice versa, to
            allow standard templates to be written and exchange of templates between databases
