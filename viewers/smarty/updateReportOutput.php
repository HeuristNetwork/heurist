/**
* updateReportOutput.php  - for backward capability. See ReportController
*
* It takes a report ID (rps_ID in usrReportSchedule) and writes out the report (html and js files)
* to the location specified for that ID.
* If ID is 0 it should trigger sequential refreshing of all the reports
*
* parameters
* 'id' - key field value in usrReportSchedule
* 'mode' - if publish>0: js or html (default) - output format
* 'publish' - 0 vsn 3 UI (smarty tab),  1 - publish,  2 - no browser output (save into file only)
*                 3 - redirect the existing report (use already publshed output), if it does not exist publish=1
*
* If publish=1 then the script displays a web page with a report on the process
* (success or errors as below). If not set, then the errors (file can't be written, can't find template,
* can't find file path, empty query etc) are sent by email to the database owner.
