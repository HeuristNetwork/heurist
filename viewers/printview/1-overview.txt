Overview:	Routines for rendering views of the search subset using XSL transforms

Notes:      This functionality has not been updated from version 3. Heurist version 3 search
            rendering operates as an independent retrieval based on the search criteria and
            will not therefore render the expanded subset resulting from the application of rules.

            In theory, these functions can render quite sophisticated views of the data, however the
            XSLs are built on internal codes from version 2 which in many cases will have changed
            with the introduction of improved data structures in version 3. They will therefore require
            significant editing, and should be revised to use global concept codes rather than internal
            codes which are inherently unstable.
