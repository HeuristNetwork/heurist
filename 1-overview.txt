Overview:    Heurist is a flexible web-based collaborative database management system built in php, javascript and mysql. It was developed from late 2005 by Ian Johnson, Archaeological Computing Laboratory, University of Sydney, with the assistance of ACL programmers.

Heurist is designed primarily for academic research data (including web bookmarking and bibliographic data), but has been used successfully in undergraduate teaching as a blogging, bibliography and student project tool.

For full information please visit http://HeuristNetwork.org

Documentation standards and overall structure are described in files in the /documentation directory

INSTALLATION: please move the two files "move_to_parent_as_ ....." to the parent of the Heurist instances
              (this is done automatically by the installation script) and edit the heuristConfigIni.php file in the parent directory.
              Settings for individual instances, which override the parent configuration, can be set in the configIni.php file.
