DIRECTORY STRUCTURE FOR HEURIST WEB SERVER

Ian Johnson rev. 28 april 2014

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Root web directory:    /var/www/html (used in examples below)  

Heurist directory:    /var/www/html/HEURIST  (may be installed in any web location)

            All Heurist files except the file store are in this directory to keep them
            clear of other files in the root of the web server.
            The location of HEURIST is represented as an ellipsis ( ... ) below

SUMMARY:

                    index.html              Heurist homepage providing access to services
                                            Copy from parentDirectory_index.html in Heurist codebase root
    
                    heuristConfigIni.php    Overrides configIni.php in individual instances
                                            Copy from heuristConfigIni.php in Heurist codebase root

                    h3                      Production instance
                        help                Simlink to ../HEURIST_SUPPORT/help
                        external            Simlink to ../HEURIST_SUPPORT/external

                    HEURIST_SUPPORT         Download from link on Google Code site
                        help                directory    
                        external            directory
                        exemplars           directory

                    HEURIST_FILESTORE       Simlink to actual location of file store
                                            eg. /srv/HEURIST_FILESTORE


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Heurist instances:      .../HEURIST/h3
                        .../HEURIST/h3-beta
                        .../HEURIST/h3-alpha

            These are normally database-compatible, allowing switch between instances eg. to access
            a new feature or where a bug is encountered in an old feature. Exceptionally there will
            be a short period of backward incompatibility when the database structure is upgraded
            Heurist detects when it accesses an older database format version and offers an upgrade 
            if the format is outdated - it will not access the database if it is a different version.

Master configuration:    .../HEURIST/heuristConfigIni.php

            MySQL password and other setup information in /var/www/HEURIST/heuristConfigIni.php
            This overrides the individual configIni.php files in the individual Heurist instances
            so that they do not need configuring when a new update is installed. This file can be
            copied from heuristConfigIni.php in the root of the Heurist codebase


Support files:          .../HEURIST/HEURIST_SUPPORT/  external, help and exemplars

            These directories are simlinked as external, help and exemplars in the root of each Heurist
            instance, so that they are shared and need not be copied with each update and/or
            can be updated separately. Updates of Heurist may require additional external functions
            which will be included with the Heurist distribution.

File store:             /srv/HEURIST_FILESTORE, simlinked as /var/www/html/HEURIST_FILESTORE

            Stores all uploaded data files, images, icons, templates and temporary files for each 
            database in subdirectories with the name of that database (excluding the hdb_ database
            name prefix. This folder must be writable by PHP. It should be located in an appropriate 
            loction for data storgage, such as /srv, /data, /mnt, rather than in the web directory.

            Note: while uploaded files, images, and templates need not be web accessible, record type
            icons are currently (Vsn 3) loaded directly by the web browser. Consequently the filestore must
            be in a web accessible path. Use .htaccess control to block direct access to uploaded files
            and images; Heurist obfuscates the URL it uses to access uploaded files and images, to 
            prevent bulk download by sequential incrementation of file URLs, but nothing stops Apache 
            delivering the original files if you have their file names. 

Home page:              .../HEURIST/index.html

            A home page for Heurist on any server runnign Heurist. Provides navigation to user registration, 
            create new database, open existing database, documentation and the Heurist Network project 
            pages (HeuristNetwork.org). This file is provided as parentDirectory_index.html in the root 
            of the Heurist codebase.
            
            Note: index.html expects the main installation of Heurist to be in subdirectory .../HEURIST/h3
 
File permissions:       Suggested ownership of all data and program files is apache:apache with write access 
                        to the filestore for owner and group. On some systems you may use www-data or nobody

            
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For USyd-supported installations only:
            
Sync script:        .../HEURIST/sync_heurist_from_USyd_VS2.sh

            Uses rsync to create and/or update a specified version (h3, h3-ao, h3-ij, h3-alpha, h3-beta) 
            of Heurist from the USyd VS2 virtual server. Requires sudo access to VS2
            Also sets ownership and permissions on the copied files. Includes simlinks to support directories.
