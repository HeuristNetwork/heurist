DIRECTORY STRUCTURE FOR HEURIST WEB SERVER

Ian Johnson rev. 12 Feb 2016

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Root web directory:    /var/www/html (used in examples below)

Heurist directory:    /var/www/html/HEURIST  (HEURIST may be installed in any web location)

            All Heurist files except the file store are in this directory to keep them
            clear of other files in the root of the web server. The file store can be in a
            suitable data location eg. /srv or on a separate data server mounted in / and simlinked

            The location of HEURIST is represented as an ellipsis ( ... ) below

VERSION 4 (June  2015 onwards)

SUMMARY:

    /var/www/html                           Optional: place simlinks in web root to shorten URL paths

                    h4                      Simlink to .../HEURIST/h4
                    h4-xx                   Simlinks to .../HEURIST/h4-ao, h4-ij, h4-alpha, h4-beta etc.

    /var/www/html/HEURIST/                  All Heurist files in this directory (file store normally a simlink))

                    index.html              Heurist homepage providing access to services
                                            Supplied as move_to_parent_as_index.html in Heurist codebase root
                                            (file is moved and renamed by installaton script)

                    heuristConfigIni.php    General configuration of Heurist on a particular server
                                            Can be overriden by values supplied through configIni.php for individual instances
                                            Supplied as move_to_parent_as_heuristConfigIni.php in Heurist codebase root
                                            (file is moved and renamed by installation script)

                    h4                      Production instance
                        help                Simlink to ../HEURIST_SUPPORT/help
                        external            Simlink to ../HEURIST_SUPPORT/external (3rd party code for older code (pre vsn 4))
                        ext                 Simlink to ../HEURIST_SUPPORT/external-h4 (3rd party code for newer code (vsn 4 on))

                    h4-xx                  Alpha, beta, etc. instances
                        help                Simlink to ../HEURIST_SUPPORT/help
                        external            Simlink to ../HEURIST_SUPPORT/external
                        ext                 Simlink to ../HEURIST_SUPPORT/external-h4

                    HEURIST_SUPPORT         Download from link on Google Code site
                        help                directory
                        external            directory
                        external-h4         directory

                    HEURIST_FILESTORE       Simlink to actual location of file store
                                            eg. /srv/HEURIST_FILESTORE


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Heurist instances:      .../HEURIST/h4
                        .../HEURIST/h4-beta
                        .../HEURIST/h4-alpha
                        .../HEURIST/h4-ao
                        .../HEURIST/h4-ij

            These are normally database-compatible, allowing switch between instances eg. to access
            a new feature or where a bug is encountered in an old feature. Exceptionally there will
            be a short period of backward incompatibility when the database structure is upgraded
            Heurist detects when it accesses an older database format version and offers an upgrade
            if the format is outdated - it will not access the database if it is a different version.

Master configuration:    .../HEURIST/heuristConfigIni.php

            MySQL password and other setup information in /var/www/html/HEURIST/heuristConfigIni.php
            This can be overridden for individual instancess by values in the configIni.php files in
            the individual instance - the values are normally left blank - so that all instances are.
            configured by a single file, obviating the need for configuration when a new update is
            installed. This file is copied from move_to_parent_as_heuristConfigIni.php in the root
            of the Heurist codebase

Support files:          .../HEURIST/HEURIST_SUPPORT/  external, external-h4, and help

            These directories are simlinked as external, ext, and help in the root of each Heurist
            instance, so that they are shared and need not be copied with each update and/or can be
            updated separately. Updates of Heurist may require additional external functions which will
            be included as a new directory with cumulative updates as part of the Heurist distribution.

File store:             /srv/HEURIST_FILESTORE, simlinked as /var/www/html/HEURIST_FILESTORE

            Stores all uploaded data files, images, icons, templates and temporary files for each
            database in subdirectories with the name of that database (excluding the hdb_ database
            name prefix. This folder must be writable by PHP. It should be located in an appropriate
            loction for data storgage, such as /srv, /data, /mnt, rather than in the web directory.

            Note: while uploaded files, images, and templates need not be web accessible, record type
            icons are currently loaded directly by the web browser. Consequently the filestore must
            be in a web accessible path. .htaccess control is used to block direct access to uploaded files
            and images; Heurist also obfuscates the URL it uses to access uploaded files and images, to
            prevent bulk download by sequential incrementation of file URLs, but nothing stops Apache
            delivering the original files given the file name, hence the need for .htaccess controls.

Home page:              .../HEURIST/index.html

            A home page for Heurist on any server running Heurist. Provides navigation to user registration,
            create new database, open existing database, documentation and the Heurist Network project
            pages (HeuristNetwork.org). This file is provided as move_to_parent_as_index.html in the root
            of the Heurist codebase.

            Note: index.html expects the main installation of Heurist to be in subdirectory .../HEURIST/h4
                  as it looks in this path to find its CSS files. Edit path if there is no Heurist installation
                  in this location.

File permissions:

            Suggested ownership of all data and program files is www-data:www-data or apache:apache with write access
            to the filestore for owner and group. On some systems (notably with a separate file server)you may
            need to use nobody


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Increasing security of data

By default, Heurist hides data directories by including an index.html file which will capture attempts to see the index
of the directory, as well as a .htaccess file in the root filestore directory to stop download of files in this and its
descendants. There are also .htaccess files in every rectype-icons, hml, html and filethumbs directories to override this
global block. However .htaccess specifications are not respected by default, so it is necessary to edit the apache
configuration in /etc/apache2/conf.d/security to enable .htaccess (See HeuristNetwork website under Developers > Installation).
You may also use the following (modify if the filestore has been moved)

    <Directory ~ /HEURIST_FILESTORE>
    Options Includes FollowSymLinks MultiViews
    Order Allow,Deny
    Deny from all
    </Directory>

    <Directory ~ /HEURIST_FILESTORE/\w*/rectype-icons>
    Order Allow,Deny
    Allow from all
    </Directory>

    <Directory ~ /HEURIST_FILESTORE/\w*/filethumbs>
    Order Allow,Deny
    Allow from all
    </Directory>

    <Directory ~ /HEURIST_FILESTORE/\w*/html-output>
    Order Allow,Deny
    Allow from all
    </Directory>

    <Directory ~ /HEURIST_FILESTORE/\w*/hml-output>
    Order Allow,Deny
    Allow from all
    </Directory>

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For USyd-supported installations only:

Sync script:        .../HEURIST/sync_heurist_from_USyd_VS2.sh

            Uses rsync to create and/or update a specified version (h4, h4-ao, h4-ij, h4-alpha, h4-beta)
            of Heurist from the USyd VS2 virtual server. Requires sudo access to VS2
            Also sets ownership and permissions on the copied files. Includes simlinks to support directories.
