CODE QUALITY AND VULNERABILITY TESTING
--------------------------------------

We are currently (June 2024) using Snyk and Sonar Cloud, along with occasional reports from tests by University of Melbourne and Biblioth√®que Nationale de France.  

SNYK

As of June 2024 reporting 8 High and a few medium and low. The HIGHs are false positives from an external library UploadHandler.php used to upload images and other files we wish to store in the database. Snyk fails to recognise that we have restricted uploads to specific directories and stps taken to sanitise text.
