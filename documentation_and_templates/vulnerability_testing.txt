CODE QUALITY AND VULNERABILITY TESTING
--------------------------------------
We are currently (June 2024) using Snyk and Sonar Cloud, along with occasional reports from tests by University of Melbourne and Biblioth√®que Nationale de France.  

** SQL Injection
    Unsanitized input from an HTTP parameter or database flows into query, where it is used in an SQL query. 
    This may result in an SQL Injection vulnerability

    1) use parameterized queries with help of functions: mysql__insertupdate, mysql__select_param_query, mysql__exec_param_query
    2) use intval if applicable

** Path Traversal
    Unsanitized input from an HTTP parameter or database flows into file function
    where it is used as a path. This may result in a Path Traversal vulnerability 
    and allow an attacker to manipulate with arbitrary files.

1) php functions realpath  or basename
2) use Heurist methods isPathInHeuristUploadFolder, sanitizePath 


** Cross-site Scripting (XSS) 
    Unsanitized input from an HTTP parameter or database flows into the echo statement, 
    where it is used to render an HTML page returned to the user. 
    This may result in a Cross-Site Scripting attack (XSS).

    1) filter_input, filter_input_array to mediate $_REQUEST
    2) htmlentities, htmlspecialchars for print and echo

** Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
    Unsanitized input from an HTTP parameter or database flows into file_get_contents or curl, where it 
    is used as an URL to perform a request. This may result in a Server-Side Request 
    Forgery vulnerability.

    1) filter_input, filter_input_array

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------    
** Improper Access Control: Email Content Injection 
    An attacker could inject HTML or plaintext content from an HTTP header, a database or remote resource
    into mail, which is used to generate and send email.
    
    These warnings are ignored since all content is taken from the database, from the Heurist log files or 
    from the $_SERVER variable (http header) to aid in debugging the system. Emails are sent automatically 
    to the system administrator (sign ups, bugs, errors, system reports etc.). Emails with content derived 
    from the database may also be generated by the system administrator. 
    The only opportunity for other Heurist users to send email is via the "Record reminders" function.
    
** Information Exposure
    An exception object flows to the echo statement and is leaked to the attacker
    
    These warnings are ignored since these are debug information to be sent to system admin  about exceptions for email or smarty.

** Origin Validation Error
    header("Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *") is required for public API response and iiif presentation
