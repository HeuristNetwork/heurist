CODE QUALITY AND VULNERABILITY TESTING
--------------------------------------

We are currently (June 2024) using Snyk and Sonar Cloud, along with occasional reports from tests by University of Melbourne and Biblioth√®que Nationale de France.  

SNYK

** SQL Injection:
Unsanitized input from an HTTP parameter or database flows into query, where it is used in an SQL query. 
This may result in an SQL Injection vulnerability

1) use parameterized queries with help of functions: mysql__insertupdate, mysql__select_param_query, mysql__exec_param_query
2) intval

** Path Traversal:
Unsanitized input from an HTTP parameter or database flows into file function
where it is used as a path. This may result in a Path Traversal vulnerability 
and allow an attacker to manipulate with arbitrary files.

1) use Heurist methods isPathInHeuristUploadFolder   sanitizePath 
2) or php functions realpath  or basename


** Cross-site Scripting (XSS) 
Unsanitized input from an HTTP parameter or database flows into the echo statement, 
where it is used to render an HTML page returned to the user. 
This may result in a Cross-Site Scripting attack (XSS).

filter_input, filter_input_array
htmlentities, htmlspecialchars

** Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
Unsanitized input from an HTTP parameter or database flows into file_get_contents, where it 
is used as an URL to perform a request. This may result in a Server-Side Request 
Forgery vulnerability.

filter_input, filter_input_array
