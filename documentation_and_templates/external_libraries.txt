Updated 4 March 2019, Artem Osmakov, revised Ian Johnson 23 Aug 2021

External code libraries, not included in the Heurist git repository, are in the following directories simlinked from each instance of the Heurist code:

.../HEURIST_SUPPORT/external_h5 is simlinked as /external
.../HEURIST_SUPPORT/vendor is simlinked as /vendor
.../HEURIST_SUPPORT/help is simlinked as /help

External libraries managed by composer (see composer.json) are in .../HEURIST_SUPPORT/vendors

Note: The following libraries are accessed directly on the web via their URL. They also exist in HEURIST_SUPPORT/external-h5 so that Heurist can be run on a local machine with no internet access and in case the web versions should ever disappear.

    Datatables 1.10.21
    Fancytree 2.16.1
    JQuery 1.12  version 2 and 3 are very different, large cost to upgrade
    JQuery-file-upload 9.5.7

See also /documentation_and_templates/modifications_to_external_functions.txt for specific changes that have been made to the source code of these functions (where unavoidable), and the reasons for modification.
