Directory:	/saved_searches

Overview:	Saved searches record a Heurist query for either a single user 
		or a workgroup, and are displayed in a tree on the left of the 
		main search page.

Notes:		Saved searches can be used to publish subsets of the database through 
		the Publish function, avoiding the needc to specify the query in the 
		publication URL so that it cannot be modified externally to access 
		unintended information
