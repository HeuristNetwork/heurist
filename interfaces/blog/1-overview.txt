Overview:	Blog view is a special view generated from search results. 
		It has flexibility to render any set of search results, but is 
		normally used to generate a conventional blog view by displaying 
		records of type Blog Entry for the last month, with navigation to 
		older subsets. 

Notes:		Users automatically have access to a blog of their own blog entry 
		records (which is defined as all entries bookmarked by them, including 
		blog entries created by other people, a fact which is indicated clearly 
		on the entry). 

		They also have access to a shared blog for each workgroup of which they 
		are a member. In this case, the entries in the blog are defined as all 
		those records owned by the workgroup (which largely means those created 
		in the workgroup blog).

		Blog entries also have threaded discussions/cpmments attached, which are
		user-specific, and can be mapped, related to one another and edited repeatedly.
