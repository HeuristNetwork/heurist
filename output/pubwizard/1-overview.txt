Directory:	/pubwizard

Overview:	Functions to implement the Publish button on the main search page. 
		The Publish function saves the current search as a Saved Search, 
		previews a range of pre-defined XSLT transforms of the HML generated, 
		and gives the user html/javascript code for embedding the previewed 
		search results as a live query in a web page/site. 

Notes:		As at April 2010, Publish Wizard processes old style Heurist XML, not HML.
		A cocoon transform converts HML generated by hml.php into old style XML
		(this was done to avoid rewriting al lthe existing stylesheets)

		New XSLT stylesheets are placed in the /pubwizard/xsl directory 
		and, subject to correct formatting (see template stylesheet in that location)
		will appear in the user’s pulldown lsit of styles. However stylesheets can 
		also be referenced at a remote URL.
