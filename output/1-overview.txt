Overview:	Functions for getting data out of Heurist. This is a broad category 
		which includes human-readable publishing of PDF files or web pages 
		and export of XML files for data exchange, transformation and archiving.  

Notes:		Most of Heurist’s export functions commence with the export of XML in 
		Heurist Markup Language (HML) fomat, which is then submitted to an XSLT
		transformation pipeline to generate the desired format. This allows the 
		generation of anything for simple lists to a complete website.

		Some legacy code generates formatted output directly.

		Visualisations are in separate directories /mapping, 
		/timeline and /visualisation
