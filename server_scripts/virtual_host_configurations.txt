Setting up virtual hosts
------------------------

CONTENT TO BE CREATED  20/6/24

TODO:  for each of these, label with the general settup eg. redhat, rhel, debian etc. and replace anything like passwords with xxxxxxxxxxxxxx  

EXAMPLES:

for herusit.huma-num.fr virtual hosts are defined in the separate file - what file?
And ssl configuration (for https) are defined within <VirtualHost>

For intersect all :80 <VirtualHost>s are within main httpd.conf and :443 and ssl settings are are in the separate file httpd-le-ssl.conf. 

On greek server both :80 and :443 are in separate files.

On sydney uni server, there are neither virtual hosts nor ssl configuration in apache configuration files. 
I assume all configuration has been done by ICT and it is out of our control and my comprehension
