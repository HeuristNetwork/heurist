Setting up virtual hosts
------------------------

1) Purpose of VirtualHost. If your webserver runs several website/application you need to specify Virtual Host. So 
your domain heurist.example.com will refer to correct installation folder of Heurist.
                                       
2) Add to your apache httpd.conf

<VirtualHost *:80>
    DocumentRoot "/var/www/html/HEURIST/"
    ServerName heurist.example.com
    ServerAlias heurist.example.com
    AddDefaultCharset utf-8
    
    RedirectPermanent / https://heurist.example.com
</VirtualHost>

Where 
DocumentRoot - Heurist installation path 
ServerName and ServerAlias - Hostname that the server uses to identify itself
RedirectPermanent - means that all request to http will be redirected to https - specify this directive to avoid usage of http protocol.

If your server has many virtual hosts, it is better to specify them in the separate file.

Include conf/extra/httpd-vhosts.conf

3) https. If your hosting provider has HTTPS built in, follow their documentation how to include SSL certificate. 
Otherwise we recommend to use "Letsencrypt"> It is a free, automated, and open certificate authority.

https://letsencrypt.org/getting-started/
https://certbot.eff.org/

With the help of certbot your webserver will be configured and https version of your current http host be added.

<VirtualHost *:443>
    DocumentRoot "/var/www/html/HEURIST/"
    ServerName heurist.example.com
    ServerAlias heurist.example.com
    AddDefaultCharset utf-8
    
    SSLEngine on
    SSLCerificateFile /etc/letsencrypt/live/heurist.example.com/cert.pem
    SSLCerificateKeyFile /etc/letsencrypt/live/heurist.example.com/privkey.pem
    SSLCACerificateFile /etc/letsencrypt/live/heurist.example.com/chain.pem
    SSLProtocol all SSLv2 -SSLv3
    SSLHonorCipherOrder on
    SSLCipherSuite "EECFH+........"
</VirtualHost>
