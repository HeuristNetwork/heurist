THE FILES IN MONITORING, BACKUPOS AND RESTORE ARE AS-COPIED FROM HUMA-NUM SERVER

THEY NEED REVIEWING

Can we replace specific passwords with somethign that will provide the db password automatically when the script is run as root. I have seen this done somewhere, which would then make these scripts simply copyable.

Also need to check that they will run on different flavours of linux.

DELETE THIS FILE WHEN DONE
