Overview:	Heurist Vsn 3 Functions for importing and disambiguating external data
            These have not been significantly updated since version 3. They do what they do ...

Notes:	

		The bibliographic synchroniser (Zotero) is an extremely complex bit of imbricated coding developed by Tom Murtagh.

		sucasa (removed to backlog) was an experimental Picasa web album importer developed by Kim Jackson.
 		Needs a bit more work and is probably no longer relevant at 2023 because Picasa discontinued.
