Overview:	Heurist Vsn 3 Functions for importing and disambiguating external data

Notes:		In order of development:

		The bibliographic importers (EndNote, Refer and Zotero) are an
		extremely complex bit of imbricated coding developed by Tom Murtagh.
		They really need a clean redevelop.

		Fleximport and detailupdater are more recent flexible importing tools.

		sucasa is an experimental Picasa web album importer developed by Kim Jackson.
 		Needs a bit more work and is not currently (March 2010) linked into
		the Heurist interface.
