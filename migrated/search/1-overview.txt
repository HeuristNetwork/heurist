Overview:	Search is Heurist's output workhorse. It can retrieve any defined
		    subset of records with quite flexible search criteria. Each user's
		    Heurist home page is a search for records bookamarked and tagged as
		    Favourites. A range of actions can be applied to search results
		    including saving the criteria as a saved search, changing ownership,
		    tagging, un-bookmarking, merging duplicates, deleting and so forth.

		    Search is also used to publish subsets of the database as PDF files,
		    as data feeds or for embedding in web pages. XML output in HML format
		    is generated and restyled through XSLT transforms and Cocoon.

Notes:      This are Heurist version 3 search functions. Most of the search functionality is now in version 4 code
