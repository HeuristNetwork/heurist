Directory:	/search

Overview:	Search is Heurist?s output workhorse. It can retrieve any defined
		subset of records with quite flexible search criteria. Each user?s
		Heurist home page is a search for records bookamarked and tagged as
		Favourites. A range of actions can be applied to search results
		including saving the criteria as a saved search, changing ownership,
		tagging, un-bookmarking, merging duplicates, deleting and so forth.

		Search is also used to publish subsets of the database as PDF files,
		as data feeds or for embedding in web pages. XML output in HML format
		is generated and restyled through XSLT transforms and Cocoon.
