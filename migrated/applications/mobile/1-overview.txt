Overview:	A set of experimental code for a mobile viewer. Provides a pretty standard tours with stops and pathways interface.

            In theory, navigating to index.html in this directory should launch the mobile viewer.
            This function has been reworked a number of times and may not be currently functional,
            although it should not require much work to get it functioning approximately.
            Some of the code here may be deprecated.

Notes:      Expects Tours to be formatted as a collections of Stops and Segments
