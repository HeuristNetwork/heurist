Remove Geo from initial fields in new record type - only title, summary, thumbnail

Align terminology: reltype, relmarker, resource, field type

Changedatabase structure to 1.2.0
Add automaticdatabase update script
Update crosswalk template files
Update coreDefinitions.txt, add bibliographic record types, place, gpx, map, events,
fixup biblio types Andrew did not do, Type filed in  Place is ?text
Change default record visibility to Hidden (at least 3 SQL files))

Chnagebugsymbol to Bug report
Fix take the tour

Installation: problem with creation of php.ini

People always want to call a record type by the first entity they think of of that type,
so they will define Collection as "Fred George Collection" (Ien, Una, ...)

Update help text for smarty reports

Update default report gneerated as new report

Check that URLs are not switched on for most record types (currently on for People)

Warning popup on selection of a text field suggesintg use of terms list, record pointer or relationship marker
(make this a fairly detailed help screen describing the optimal field types to use)

        "You've selected a TEXT field type. This type of field is suitable for unconstrained text, including names, 
        notes and descriptions which only occur once within a set of records. If a name eg. of a person, place or other
        attribute reoccurs frequently, please consider one of the alternatives below:
                
          Terms list: if the same text value is reused in many records eg. an attribute or categorisation of each entity, 
          use a terms list - you can create a hierarchy of terms and add codes and more detailed descriptions to each term.
          Term lists are generally good for categorisation or where there are a small set  of alternatives and one does not
          need to record much information about the alternatives.
          
          Record pointer: if you need to attach an attribute such as the name of a person, organisation, melody, work, document, 
          period, event, place, ship, structure, etc. consider treating each of these concepts as a separate entity, with its 
          own set of fields, and use a record pointer which links to one of these entities. This allows additional 
          information to be recorded about each entity.
          
          Relationship marker: Like record pointers, relationship markers allow values to be specified through linked entities,
          but in addition allow a temporal span, type of relationship, notes and interpretations to be specified. This is useful
          where there are many possible relationships eg. roles (as an alternative to a separate field for each role), or where 
          values are not permanent attributes eg. ownership, curation, location, sponsorship, membership, marriage.

Improve workflow for vocabularies and term definition, explain what level youareat and suggest naming conventions

Remove the tedious new field insert loop, insert directly

Better positioning of added fields at insertion point rather than down the bottom of the structure list

Don't allow delete of record types if they are used in any pointer or relationship marker field definition, 
or in record relationship constraints

Don't allow delete of terms if they are used in any terms list field definition, including relationship type or relationship constraints

In report output, only Query sorts correctly (not Selected or All on page). ? unfixable.

Sort of numeric field is not numeric

No sort on ID (may be available, but not in pulldown? Needs to be numeric)

Position cursor in middle of loop and in middle of IF (one works,one may be fixed)

Import CSV multiple columns to same field (repeat if possible, concatenate text, reject on single value fields)

Consistency ofg  Cancelbutton aslast button, or prefer just a hyperlink

Advanced (search) as hyperlink under search

Facetted search

Save Search should be foregrounded, eg. link under the search field

When Help is off in edit view, add help icons with popop

Edit: highlight fields in error, eg. required fields, fields required for title mask

Functions in title mask

Better editing of title mask - make it a memo field so you can see and edit the whole mask. 

Only require to read ONE record for title mask tree (actually, only needs structure)

Better  positioning of new definition button

  Designer View: message appears behind top bar, and unreadable, when it detects that the database folder 
  is unwritable - this also stuffs up load of search so you don't get the navigationpanel - it is overwritten by the results panel
  We need more graceful failure and a better error message 


Edit record: Move image type pulldown away from current location
  confusingly like record type on within-record search popup, we don't want people changing it
  
Mke upload filepaths in ulf table relative

Aito-add stored procedures if they are missing from database

Require upload/selection of iconsfor new record types

Offer option to choose from default set of icons
Tie thumbnail and icon together in defualt set so you don't need to choose twice
Add URL to full library(ies) included in our icon library

Detect and report failure of thumbnailing service - currently fails silently

Queries which specify a term should automatically retreive on all child terms

Method for eliminating unused terms- show usage count (?), don't allow deletion if used by any enum field, including all members of a vocabulary used by an enum

Structure import: Make sure all members of a vocabulary are imported when you import an enum field definition which uses a vocabulary

Database schema listing: analyse record structures nand list:
    Pointere fields - target types, required, usage stats
    Relationship markers - taerget types, relationship types, required, usage stats
    
Data verification
    Records with missing required fields
    Records with missing recommended fields
    Records with multiple values in single value fields
    Records with fields not in structure for record type
    Pointers to non-existent records

Title mask: need to avoid blank mask when the Name/title field is deleted eg. warning before allowing exit from structure and pop up edit

Title mask: if none of the title mask fields have data, replace title with "No data entered for title fields in this record"

Edit record: warn before exit (after checking for required fields) if no title maskfields have been entered and allow user to return to edit form
    "You have not entered any data in the fields used to construct the record title (xxxx, xxxx, xxxx ...) which will leave this record with a blank title.
     This makes it very hard to identify records in search results. You probably need to edit the title mask or field requirements 
     (click link at top right of the edit form, edit the record type definition).
     At least one of the title mask fields should normally be a required field to avoid this situation"
     
Edit record: remove section at end allowing addition of non-standard fields (it is now so easy to add fields, and it doesn't workinany case on Mac Safari)

User profile: dump all my data: Add --routines to script which dumps the database
